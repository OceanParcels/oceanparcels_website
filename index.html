                As ocean general circulation models (OGCMs) move into the
                petascale age, where the output of single simulations exceeds
                petabytes of storage space, tools to analyse the output of these
                models will need to scale up too. Lagrangian ocean analysis,
                where virtual particles are tracked through hydrodynamic fields,
                is an increasingly popular way to analyse OGCM output, by
                mapping pathways and connectivity of biotic and abiotic
                particulates. However, the current software stack of Lagrangian
                ocean analysis codes is not dynamic enough to cope with the
                increasing complexity, scale and need for customization of
                use-cases. Furthermore, most community codes are developed for
                stand-alone use, making it a nontrivial task to integrate
                virtual particles at runtime of the OGCM. Here, we introduce the
                new Parcels code, which was designed from the ground up to be
                sufficiently scalable to cope with petascale computing. We
                highlight its API design that combines flexibility and
                customization with the ability to optimize for HPC workflows,
                following the paradigm of domain-specific languages. Parcels is
                primarily written in Python, utilizing the wide range of tools
                available in the scientific Python ecosystem, while generating
                low-level C code and using just-in-time compilation for
                performance-critical computation. We show a worked-out example
                of its API, and validate the accuracy of the code against seven
                idealized test cases. This version 0.9 of Parcels is focused on
                laying out the API, with future work concentrating on support
                for curvilinear grids, optimization, efficiency and at-runtime
                coupling with OGCMs.

                With the increasing amount of data produced by numerical ocean
                models, so increases the need for efficient tools to analyse
                these data. One of these tools is Lagrangian ocean analysis,
                where a set of virtual particles are released and their dynamics
                is integrated in time based on fields defining the ocean state,
                including the hydrodynamics and biogeochemistry if available.
                This popular methodology needs to adapt to the large variety of
                models producing these fields at different formats. This is
                precisely the aim of Parcels, a Lagrangian ocean analysis
                framework designed to combine (1) a wide flexibility to model
                particles of different natures and (2) an efficient
                implementation in accordance with modern computing
                infrastructure. In the new Parcels v2.0, we implement a set of
                interpolation schemes to read various types of discretised
                fields, from rectilinear to curvilinear grids in the horizontal
                direction, from z- to s- levels in the vertical and different
                variable distributions such as the Arakawa's A-, B- and C-
                grids. In particular, we develop a new interpolation scheme for
                a three-dimensional curvilinear C-grid and analyse its
                properties. Parcels v2.0 capabilities, including a suite of
                meta-field objects, are then illustrated in a brief study of the
                distribution of floating microplastic in the North West European

                    Studying oceanography by using Lagrangian simulations has
                    been adopted for a range of scenarios, such as the
                    determining the fate of microplastics in the ocean,
                    simulating the origin locations of microplankton used for
                    palaeoceanographic reconstructions, for studying the impact
                    of fish aggregation devices on the migration behaviour of
                    tuna. These simulations are complex and represent a
                    considerable runtime effort to obtain trajectory results,
                    which is the prime motivation for enhancing the performance
                    of Lagrangian particle simulators. This paper assesses
                    established performance enhancing techniques from Eulerian
                    simulators in light of computational conditions and demands
                    of Lagrangian simulators. A performance enhancement strategy
                    specifically targeting physics-based Lagrangian particle
                    simulations is outlined to address the performance gaps, and
                    techniques for closing the performance gap are presented and
                    implemented. Realistic experiments are derived from three
                    specific oceanographic application scenarios, and the
                    suggested performance-enhancing techniques are benchmarked
                    in detail, so to allow for a good attribution of speed-up
                    measurements to individual techniques. The impacts and
                    insights of the performance enhancement strategy are further
                    discussed for Lagrangian simulations in other geoscience
                    applications. The experiments show that I/O-enhancing
                    techniques, such as dynamic loading and buffering, lead to
                    considerable speed-up on-par with an idealised
                    parallelisation of the process over 20 nodes. Conversely,
                    while the cache-efficient structure-of-arrays collection
                    yields a visible speed-up, other alternative data structures
                    fail in fulfilling the theoretically-expected performance
                    increase. This insight demonstrates the importance of good
                    data alignment in memory and caches for Lagrangian physics
                    simulations.

      <h2 id="installing">Installing Parcels</h2>

      The simplest way to install the Parcels code is to use Anaconda and the
      Parcels Conda-Forge package with the latest release of Parcels. This
      package will automatically install (almost) all the requirements for a
      fully functional installation of Parcels. This is the “batteries-included”
      solution probably suitable for most users.
      <p></p>
      The steps below are the installation instructions for Linux / macOS and
      for Windows. If the commands for Linux / macOS and Windows differ, this is
      indicated with a comment at the end of the line.
      <p></p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Install Anaconda's Miniconda following the steps at
          <a href="https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/install/"
            >https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/install/</a
          >, making sure to select the Python-3 version. If you're on Linux /
          macOS, it also assumes that you installed Miniconda-3 to your home
          directory.
        </li>
        <p></p>
        <li>
          Start a terminal (Linux / macOS) or the Anaconda prompt (Windows).
          Activate the root (or base) environment of your Miniconda and create
          an environment containing Parcels, all its essential dependencies, and
          the nice-to-have Jupyter, cartopy, and ffmpeg packages:
          <pre><code class="language-bash">conda activate root  # Linux / macOS
activate root        # Windows

conda create -n py3_parcels -c conda-forge parcels jupyter cartopy ffmpeg</code></pre>
        </li>
        <!--<i>*Note that Parcels has a problem with the latest release of the netCDF4 library, v1.4.2 (see also <a href="https://github.com/OceanParcels/parcels/issues/513">Issue #513 on github</a>). For the time being, we recommend downgrading to v1.4.1, using <code class="language-bash">conda install netcdf4=1.4.1</code></i>-->
        <i
          >*Note that for some of the examples,
          <code class="language-bash">pytest</code> needs to be installed with
          <code class="language-bash">conda install -n py3_parcels pytest</code
          >.</i
        >
        <p></p>
        <li>
          Activate the newly created Parcels environment.
          <pre><code class="language-bash">conda activate py3_parcels  # Linux / macOS
activate py3_parcels        # Windows</code></pre>
        </li>
        <li>
          Get a copy of the Parcels tutorials and examples, as well as the data
          required to run these:
          <pre><code class="language-bash">parcels_get_examples parcels_examples</code></pre>
        </li>
        <i
          >*Note that if you are on Windows and you get a
          <code>Fatal error in launcher</code> error, you can instead download
          the data with</i
        >
        <i>
          <pre><code class="language-bash">curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OceanParcels/parcels/master/parcels/scripts/get_examples.py &gt; parcels_get_examples.py
python parcels_get_examples.py parcels_examples</code></pre>
        </i>
        <li>
          Run the simplest of the examples to validate that you have a working
          Parcels setup:
          <pre><code class="language-bash">cd parcels_examples
python example_peninsula.py --fieldset 100 100</code></pre>
        </li>
        <i
          >*Note that if you are on macOS and get a compilation error, you may
          need to accept the Apple xcode license
        </i>
        (<code class="language-bash">xcode-select --install</code
        >).
        <i
          >If this does not solve the compilation error, you may want to try
          running
        </i>
        <code class="language-bash">export CC=gcc</code>
        <i
          >. If the compilation error remains, you may want to check
          <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/58323411/5172570"
            >this solution</a
          ></i
        >.
        <p></p>
        <li>
          Optionally, if you want to run all the examples and tutorials, start
          Jupyter and open the tutorial notebooks:
          <pre><code class="language-bash">jupyter notebook</code></pre>
        </li>
        <p></p>
        <li>
          The next time you start a terminal and want to work with Parcels,
          activate the environment with:
          <pre><code class="language-bash">conda activate py3_parcels  # Linux / macOS
activate py3_parcels        # Windows</code></pre>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p></p>
      <h4>Installing a non-released version of Parcels</h4>

      There might be cases where you want to install a version of Parcels that
      has not been released yet. (Perhaps, if you want to use a bleeding-edge
      feature which already is included on Github, but not in the conda-forge
      package.) Then, just after step 2 of
      <a href="#installing">Installing Parcels</a> above, use the following
      commands to remove the conda-forge package again, and use
      <code>pip</code> to install Parcels from Github:
      <pre><code class="language-bash">conda activate py3_parcels  # Linux / macOS
activate py3_parcels        # Windows

conda remove --force parcels
pip install git+https://github.com/OceanParcels/parcels.git@master
</code></pre>
      <p></p>
      <h4>Installation for developers</h4>

      Parcels depends on a working Python installation, a netCDF installation, a
      C compiler, and various Python packages. If you prefer to maintain your
      own Python installation providing all this,
      <code class="language-bash">git clone</code> the
      <a href="https://github.com/OceanParcels/parcels"
        >master branch of Parcels</a
      >
      and manually install all packages listed under
      <code>dependencies</code> in the environment files (<a
        href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OceanParcels/parcels/master/environment_py3_linux.yml"
        >environment_py3_linux.yml</a
      >
      for Linux,
      <a
        href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OceanParcels/parcels/master/environment_py3_osx.yml"
        >environment_py3_osx.yml</a
      >
      for OSX and
      <a
        href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OceanParcels/parcels/master/environment_py3_win.yml"
        >environment_py3_win.yml</a
      >
      for Windows), before running
      <code class="language-bash">python setup.py install --prefix=PREFIX</code>
      where <code class="language-bash">PREFIX</code> is the path to the
      directory of your local branch of the parcels code.

      <p></p>
      <h4 id="parallel_install">Installation of Parallel Parcels with MPI</h4>
      Parcels uses MPI for parallel execution, but this only works on linux and
      macOS. To install it, follow the steps below and see
      <a
        href="https://docs.oceanparcels.org/en/latest/examples/documentation_MPI.html"
        >here for further documentation</a
      >
      <p></p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          We strongly encourage to create a new environment for Parallel
          Parcels:
          <pre><code class="language-bash">conda create -n py3_parcels_mpi -c conda-forge parcels mpi4py mpich scikit-learn jupyter cartopy ffmpeg
conda activate py3_parcels_mpi</code></pre>
        </li>
        <p></p>
        <li>
          If you are on a Mac, you may need to issue
          <pre><code class="language-bash">export CONDA_BUILD_SYSROOT=/
export C_INCLUDE_PATH=$C_INCLUDE_PATH:/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents//Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.14.sdk/usr/include/
</code></pre>
          Where possibly you may need to change the
          <code class="language-bash">MacOSX10.14.sdk</code> into the macOS
          version you have.
        </li>
        <p></p>
        <li>
          Now, you can run in Parallel with e.g.
          <pre><code class="language-bash">mpirun -np 2 python parcels/examples/example_stommel.py -p 10
</code></pre>
          Let us know
          <a href="https://github.com/OceanParcels/parcels/issues/553"
            >your feedback</a
          >!
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h2 id="tutorials">Parcels tutorials</h2>

      The best way to get started with Parcels is to explore the Jupyter
      notebooks below. By clicking on the tutorials you can read them on the
      Jupyter notebook viewer. Due to some issues with the GitHub API some
      notebooks are temporarily not found, resulting in a 404 Error. Please find
      the corresponding notebook file by clicking the GitHub tag in the card. If
      you want to practice by interacting with them, you can either visit

                Dinoflagellate cyst assemblages present a valuable proxy to
                infer paleoceanographic conditions, yet factors influencing
                geographic distributions of species remain largely unknown,
                especially in the Southern Ocean. Strong lateral transport,
                sea-ice dynamics, and a sparse and uneven geographic
                distribution of surface sediment samples have limited the use of
                dinocyst assemblages as a quantitative proxy for
                paleo-environmental conditions such as sea surface temperature
                (SST), nutrient concentrations, salinity, and sea ice
                (presence). In this study we present a new set of surface
                sediment samples (n=66) from around Antarctica, doubling the
                number of Antarctic-proximal samples to 100 (dataset wsi_100)
                and increasing the total number of Southern Hemisphere samples
                to 655 (dataset sh_655). Additionally, we use modelled ocean
                conditions and apply Lagrangian techniques to all Southern
                Hemisphere sample stations to quantify and evaluate the
                influence of lateral transport on the sinking trajectory of
                microplankton and, with that, to the inferred ocean conditions.
                k-means cluster analysis on the wsi_100 dataset demonstrates the
                strong affinity of Selenopemphix antarctica with sea-ice
                presence and of Islandinium spp. with low-salinity conditions.
                For the entire Southern Hemisphere, the k-means cluster analysis
                identifies nine clusters with a characteristic assemblage. In
                most clusters a single dinocyst species dominates the
                assemblage. These clusters correspond to well-defined oceanic
                conditions in specific Southern Ocean zones or along the ocean
                fronts. We find that, when lateral transport is predominantly
                zonal, the environmental parameters inferred from the sea floor
                assemblages mostly correspond to those of the overlying ocean
                surface. In this case, the transport factor can thus be
                neglected and will not represent a bias in the reconstructions.
                Yet, for some individual sites, e.g. deep-water sites or sites
                under strong-current regimes, lateral transport can play a large
                role. The results of our study further constrain environmental
                conditions represented by dinocyst assemblages and the location
                of Southern Ocean frontal systems.

                The dynamics of fluid flows give rise to robust, persistent
                circulation features that underpin the flow and exert strong
                control over the advection of water masses, either enhancing it
                or supressing it, collectively known as lagrangian coherent
                structures. Lagrangian approaches and metrics have been shown to
                be better suited than eulerian ones at locating and delineating
                such structures and capturing the effect they have on the
                formation and dispersion of water masses, particularly at the
                smaller scales. In this paper, we use the framework of
                lagrangian coherent structures to analyse the ocean velocity
                fields over a climatological year obtained from a
                high-resolution eddy-resolving model in order to investigate the
                lagrangian regimes that affect the motion, separation and mixing
                of water masses in the Mediterranean Sea. The lagrangian regimes
                that develop in each sub-basin over the course of the year are
                characterised and regions of persistent lagrangian activity and
                coherent structure formation and presence are identified. A
                quantitative picture of the seasonal variability of the
                lagrangian coherent structure-induced horizontal mixing and
                vortex formation is obtained.

                Previous studies have shown the presence of strong mesoscale
                eddy activities in the Indonesian Seas and their influence on
                the transport and water mass properties of the Indonesian
                Throughflow (ITF), a mean flow from the Pacific Ocean to the
                Indian Ocean through the Indonesian Archipelago. This study
                explores the effects of these eddy activities, or high-frequency
                flow variability (HFFV), on residence time and pathway of the
                ITF by conducting Lagrangian particle tracking experiments using
                a velocity field from an eddy-resolving ocean general
                circulation model. Particles are released at key locations in
                the western and eastern routes of the ITF and tracked both
                backward and forward in time. To assess the effects of flow
                variability that has a time scale longer than a day but shorter
                than a month, the definition of HFFV in this study, we conduct
                parallel experiments using daily and monthly averaged velocity
                fields. Particle trajectories reveal the contrasting circulation
                characteristics of the Sulawesi and Banda Seas. HFFV in the
                Sulawesi Sea (in the western route) is high, causing water to
                circulate longer over a broader area. The longer residence time
                in the Sulawesi Sea helps the upwelling of the inflowing Pacific
                waters, especially the intermediate water masses, to rise above
                300 m at the Makassar Strait, and also has the potential to
                allow mixing processes to modify the water mass properties of
                the ITF. In contrast, HFFV is much lower in the Banda Sea and
                has minimal effects on the ITF.

                Population sizes of the Japanese red coral Corallium japonicum
                have been severely affected by poaching and overfishing.
                Although genetic structure and connectivity patterns are
                considered important parameters for conservation strategies,
                there are few studies focusing on the population genetics of C.
                japonicum in the Northwest Pacific. We examined the genetic
                population structure of C. japonicum, in the Northwest Pacific.
                We used restriction-site-associated DNA sequencing (RAD-seq),
                which can be used to identify genome-wide single-nucleotide
                polymorphism (SNPs), to reveal detailed within-species genetic
                variations. Using the variable SNP loci identified from this
                analysis, we successfully evaluated the population-level genetic
                diversity and patterns of gene flow among multiple populations
                of C. japonicum around Japan. The results of genetic analysis
                basically showed that gene flow is widely maintained in the
                geographic range examined in this study, but the analysis in
                combination with larval dispersal simulations revealed several
                populations that were genetically distinct from the other
                populations, suggesting geographically limited gene flows. The
                information obtained from this study will be useful for the
                design of effective management schemes for C. japonicum, which
                is under threat from overfishing.

                The Labrador Current transports cold, relatively fresh, and
                well-oxygenated waters within the subpolar North Atlantic and
                towards the eastern American continental shelf. The relative
                contribution of these waters to either region depends on the
                eastward retroflection of the Labrador Current at the Grand
                Banks of Newfoundland. Here, we develop a retroflection index
                based on the pathway of virtual Lagrangian particles and show
                that strong retroflection generally occurs when a large-scale
                circulation adjustment, related to the subpolar gyre,
                accelerates the Labrador Current and shifts the Gulf Stream
                northward, partly driven by a northward shift of the wind
                patterns in the western North Atlantic. Starting in 2008, a
                particularly strong northward shift of the Gulf Stream dominates
                the other drivers. A mechanistic understanding of the drivers of
                the Labrador Current retroflection should help predict changes
                in the water properties in both export regions, and anticipate
                their impacts on marine life and deep-water formation.

                In highly fragmented and relatively stable cold-seep ecosystems,
                species are expected to exhibit high migration rates and
                long-distance dispersal of long-lived pelagic larvae to maintain
                genetic integrity over their range. Accordingly, several species
                inhabiting cold seeps are widely distributed across the whole
                Atlantic Ocean, with low genetic divergence between
                metapopulations on both sides of the Atlantic Equatorial Belt
                (AEB, i.e. Barbados and African/European margins). Two
                hypotheses may explain such patterns: (i) the occurrence of
                present-day gene flow or (ii) incomplete lineage sorting due to
                large population sizes and low mutation rates. Here, we
                evaluated the first hypothesis using the cold seep mussels
                Gigantidas childressi, G. mauritanicus, Bathymodiolus heckerae
                and B. boomerang. We combined COI barcoding of 763 individuals
                with VIKING20X larval dispersal modelling at a large spatial
                scale not previously investigated. Population genetics supported
                the parallel evolution of Gigantidas and Bathymodiolus genera in
                the Atlantic Ocean and the occurrence of a 1-3 Million-year-old
                vicariance effect that isolated populations across the Caribbean
                Sea. Both population genetics and larval dispersal modelling
                suggested that contemporary gene flow and larval exchanges are
                possible across the AEB and the Caribbean Sea, although probably
                rare. When occurring, larval flow was eastward (AEB - only for
                B. boomerang) or northward (Caribbean Sea - only for G.
                mauritanicus). Caution is nevertheless required since we focused
                on only one mitochondrial gene, which may underestimate gene
                flow if a genetic barrier exists. Non-negligible genetic
                differentiation occurred between Barbados and African
                populations, so we could not discount the incomplete lineage
                sorting hypothesis. Larval dispersal modelling simulations
                supported the genetic findings along the American coast with
                high amounts of larval flow between the Gulf of Mexico (GoM) and
                the US Atlantic Margin, although the Blake Ridge population of
                B. heckerae appeared genetically differentiated. Overall, our
                results suggest that additional studies using nuclear genetic
                markers and population genomics approaches are needed to clarify
                the evolutionary history of the Atlantic bathymodioline mussels
                and to distinguish between ongoing and past processes.

                properties of sea ice collected in the South Atlantic and Indian
                Ocean sector of the Antarctic marginal ice zone (MIZ).
                Observations of sea ice from this region in the austral spring
                2019, including sea-ice core temperature, salinity, crystal
                size, texture, oxygen isotopes and stratigraphy, were used in
                conjunction with a Lagrangian back-tracking algorithm and
                atmospheric reanalyses. This method relates the reconstructed
                synoptic conditions to sea-ice growth along the transect. A
                significant difference was found between the stratigraphy of
                consolidated pack ice samples collected at the same latitude and
                spanning over 550 km eastwards. The eastward group was found to
                have more disturbances in their stratigraphy which is attributed
                to the highly variable atmospheric and sea-ice conditions
                together with varying wave penetration through the sea-ice pack,
                notably during the passage of an intense polar cyclone, while
                the westward group showed no signs of disturbance or
                deformation. These results indicate that consolidated Antarctic
                sea-ice floes of similar thickness and from the same latitude in
                the MIZ have distinct stratigraphic properties, which will
                influence their physical and biogeochemical features.

                Coral reefs around the world are under increasing threat to
                global climate change and coral bleaching events that can result
                in severe damage and mortality to the reef systems. Some coral
                reefs are situated in areas where the complex ocean flow
                patterns and their interaction with topographical features
                around the reefs provide certain refuges to the rising ocean
                temperatures and coral bleaching. The Sodwana reef system
                experiences cold water temperature anomalies that cause
                short-term temperature fluctuations on the reefs. It is
                suggested that these temperature anomalies provide relief from
                bleaching and are an integral part of the coral’s survival at
                Sodwana. Previous studies have shown that the temperature
                anomalies are linked to regional scale hydrodynamic features
                surrounding Sodwana. We investigated the cold water pathways and
                regional flow patterns associated with the temperature anomaly
                events between 1994 and 2015 using data from the global
                reanalysed NEMO ocean model output. A comparison between
                temperature measurements taken on the Sodwana reefs and
                temperature data extracted from the model near Sodwana shows a
                good agreement and that the model replicates the temperature
                anomalies. This indicates that the temperature anomalies are
                associated with the regional hydrodynamic flow structures
                replicated in the NEMO model. We used a Lagrangian particle
                backtracking model and the hydrodynamic data from the NEMO model
                to delineate the pathways associated with the 63 temperature
                anomalies observed between 1994 and 2015. The pathways
                delineated from the Lagrangian particle backtracking model
                originate to the northeast of Sodwana within the Delagoa Bight
                region, indicating that hydrodynamics around the Delagoa Bight
                is linked to the cold water temperature anomalies observed at
                Sodwana. A statistical analysis of the modelled regional
                Eulerian flow fields showed that two representative regional
                flow fields are associated with the anomalies and representative
                pathways. The first representative flow field features a
                high-speed concentrated southward stream that separates from the
                Delagoa Bight peninsula and flows along the seaward edge of the
                Delagoa shelf and a cyclonic eddy structure within the Delagoa
                Bight. The second representative flow field features the
                southward stream that separates from the Delagoa Bight peninsula
                and flows directly to the Sodwana region with a significantly
                smaller separation zone within the Delagoa Bight. The second
                representative flow field shows no observable cyclonic eddy
                structure. The southward stream observed in all representative
                flow fields reattaches to the South African coastline near the
                Sodwana region. We also show through the mean particle vertical
                displacement and temperature change along the anomaly pathways
                that the nearshore zone within 50 km of Sodwana is a region of
                enhanced upwelling and mixing during the anomaly periods.

                Oceanic submesoscale flows are considered to be a crucial
                conduit for the downscale transfer of oceanic mesoscale kinetic
                energy and upper-ocean material exchange, both laterally and
                vertically, but defining observations revealing submesoscale
                dynamics and/or transport properties remain sparse. Here, we
                report on an elaborate observation of a warm and fresh filament
                intruding into a cyclonic mesoscale eddy. By integrating cruise
                measurements, satellite observations, particle-tracking
                simulations, and the trajectory of a surface drifter, we show
                that the filament originated from an anticyclonic eddy
                immediately to the west of the cyclonic eddy, and the evolution
                of the filament was mainly due to the geostrophic flows
                associated with the eddy pair. Our observations reveal the mass
                exchange of the eddy pair and suggest that submesoscale flows
                can degrade the coherence of mesoscale eddies, providing
                important implications for the transport properties of mesoscale
                eddies. Vigorous submesoscale turbulence was found within the
                eddy core region, due to filamentous intrusion and
                frontogenesis. Our findings have thus offered novel insights
                into the dynamics and transport properties of oceanic
                submesoscale flows, which should be taken into account in their
                simulation and parameterization in ocean and climate models.

                A common dilemma for oceanographers is the choice of horizontal
                diffusivity. There is no single answer as we could argue that
                diffusion depends precisely on those processes that cannot be
                sampled or modeled. Here we propose the radial offset by
                diffusion (ROD) method as a simple model-dependent approach for
                estimating these coefficients, and show its application for the
                southwestern South Atlantic. The method compares actual
                displacements of field drifters with numerical trajectory
                predictions. The observed-predicted differences in radial
                positions (radial offsets), which respond to diffusive motions
                not captured by the numerical model, are reproduced with a
                one-dimensional radial-diffusive solution through a proper
                selection of the diffusion coefficient. The method is tested at
                eight depths, from the sea surface down to 2000 m, using several
                drifter datasets and the Parcels software applied to the
                GLORYS12v1 (1/12° daily) velocity outputs. In all cases the
                radial offsets show Gaussian distributions that are well
                reproduced by the radial diffusive solution. Maximum
                diffusivities of 4630-4980 m2 s−1 happen in the upper 200 m of
                the water column and minimum values of 1080-1270 m2 s−1 occur
                between 1400 and 2000 m. The 15-m diffusivity is fairly constant
                in latitude (3850 to 5270 m2 s−1), but the 1000-m diffusivity
                decreases from 1640-1820 m2 s−1 north of the Polar Front to 530
                m2 s−1 south of the Southern Boundary. A comparison with other
                diffusivity studies validates the good adequacy of the ROD
                method for numerical and field applications.

                In highly fragmented and relatively stable cold-seep ecosystems,
                species are expected to exhibit high migration rates and
                long-distance dispersal of long-lived pelagic larvae to maintain
                genetic integrity over their range. Accordingly, several species
                inhabiting cold seeps are widely distributed across the whole
                Atlantic Ocean, with low genetic divergence between
                metapopulations on both sides of the Atlantic Equatorial Belt
                (AEB, i.e. Barbados and African/European margins). Two
                hypotheses may explain such patterns: (i) the occurrence of
                present-day gene flow or (ii) incomplete lineage sorting due to
                large population sizes and low mutation rates. Here, we
                evaluated the first hypothesis using the cold seep mussels
                Gigantidas childressi, G. mauritanicus, Bathymodiolus heckerae
                and B. boomerang. We combined COI barcoding of 763 individuals
                with VIKING20X larval dispersal modelling at a large spatial
                scale not previously investigated. Population genetics supported
                the parallel evolution of Gigantidas and Bathymodiolus genera in
                the Atlantic Ocean and the occurrence of a 1-3 Million-year-old
                vicariance effect that isolated populations across the Caribbean
                Sea. Both population genetics and larval dispersal modelling
                suggested that contemporary gene flow and larval exchanges are
                possible across the AEB and the Caribbean Sea, although probably
                rare. When occurring, larval flow was eastward (AEB - only for
                B. boomerang) or northward (Caribbean Sea - only for G.
                mauritanicus). Caution is nevertheless required since we focused
                on only one mitochondrial gene, which may underestimate gene
                flow if a genetic barrier exists. Non-negligible genetic
                differentiation occurred between Barbados and African
                populations, so we could not discount the incomplete lineage
                sorting hypothesis. Larval dispersal modelling simulations
                supported the genetic findings along the American coast with
                high amounts of larval flow between the Gulf of Mexico (GoM) and
                the US Atlantic Margin, although the Blake Ridge population of
                B. heckerae appeared genetically differentiated. Overall, our
                results suggest that additional studies using nuclear genetic
                markers and population genomics approaches are needed to clarify
                the evolutionary history of the Atlantic bathymodioline mussels
                and to distinguish between ongoing and past processes.

                The present study investigates the interannual variability of
                the advective pathways and transit times of the Red Sea Overflow
                Water (RSOW) in the western Arabian Sea using virtual particles
                as a proxy indicator for the poorly understood RSOW spreading.
                The Lagrangian simulations are based on the GLORYS12 eddy-rich
                reanalysis (1/12°), which assimilates most satellite and in situ
                observations from 1993 to 2018. Statistical analysis of particle
                positions reveals the Gulf's mouth is always the main RSOW
                export route out of the Gulf of Aden. Moreover, there is
                substantial interannual variability in the three RSOW pathways
                in the western Arabian Sea, which are consistent with in-situ
                salinity variability at the RSOW layer. The faster Socotra
                pathway is strongest for particles released in 1998–1999 and
                2012 and almost non-existent for the ones released in 2006–2007.
                The strongest state of the Socotra pathway co-occurs with some
                of the most powerful El-Nino/Southern Oscillation and Indian
                Ocean Dipole events in history. A decadal seesaw stands out
                between the Northwest pathway, which advects RSOW northward
                offshore the Arabian Peninsula, and the Southwest pathway, which
                advects RSOW southward to the Somali Basin along the eastern
                side of Socotra. While the Northwest pathway strengthened from
                1996 to 2011, the Southwest weakened. These changes are
                associated with interannual variability in the western boundary
                undercurrents and subsurface eddy kinetic energy. Interestingly,
                the Northwest pathway trajectories are eddy-dominated, in
                striking contrast with the Socotra and Southwest pathways, in
                which western boundary undercurrents are major players. This
                fact suggests that eddy-induced transport is likely to have a
                significant role in spreading the RSOW northward. No
                considerable interannual variability in transit times is
                detected for any pathway.

                The impact of tropical Atlantic Ocean variability modes in the
                variability of the upper-ocean circulation has been
                investigated. For this purpose, we use three oceanic reanalyses,
                an interannual forced-ocean simulation, and satellite data for
                the period 1982–2018. We have explored the changes in the main
                surface and subsurface ocean currents during the emergence of
                Atlantic meridional mode (AMM), Atlantic zonal mode (AZM), and
                AMM–AZM connection. The developing phase of the AMM is
                associated with a boreal spring intensification of North
                Equatorial Countercurrent (NECC) and a reinforced summer Eastern
                Equatorial Undercurrent (EEUC) and north South Equatorial
                Current (nSEC). During the decaying phase, the reduction of the
                wind forcing and zonal sea surface height gradient produces a
                weakening of surface circulation. For the connected AMM–AZM, in
                addition to the intensified NECC, EEUC, and nSEC in spring, an
                anomalous north-equatorial wind curl excites an oceanic Rossby
                wave (RW) that is boundary-reflected into an equatorial Kelvin
                wave (KW). The KW reverses the thermocline slope, weakening the
                nSEC and EUC in boreal summer and autumn, respectively. During
                the developing spring phase of the AZM, the nSEC is considerably
                reduced with no consistent impact at subsurface levels. During
                the autumn decaying phase, the upwelling RW-reflected mechanism
                is activated, modifying the zonal pressure gradient that
                intensifies the nSEC. The NECC is reduced in boreal
                spring–summer. Our results reveal a robust alteration of the
                upper-ocean circulation during AMM, AZM, and AMM-AZM,
                highlighting the decisive role of ocean waves in connecting the
                tropical and equatorial ocean transport.

                Studying oceanography by using Lagrangian simulations has been
                adopted for a range of scenarios, such as the determining the
                fate of microplastics in the ocean, simulating the origin
                locations of microplankton used for palaeoceanographic
                reconstructions, for studying the impact of fish aggregation
                devices on the migration behaviour of tuna. These simulations
                are complex and represent a considerable runtime effort to
                obtain trajectory results, which is the prime motivation for
                enhancing the performance of Lagrangian particle simulators.
                This paper assesses established performance enhancing techniques
                from Eulerian simulators in light of computational conditions
                and demands of Lagrangian simulators. A performance enhancement
                strategy specifically targeting physics-based Lagrangian
                particle simulations is outlined to address the performance
                gaps, and techniques for closing the performance gap are
                presented and implemented. Realistic experiments are derived
                from three specific oceanographic application scenarios, and the
                suggested performance-enhancing techniques are benchmarked in
                detail, so to allow for a good attribution of speed-up
                measurements to individual techniques. The impacts and insights
                of the performance enhancement strategy are further discussed
                for Lagrangian simulations in other geoscience applications. The
                experiments show that I/O-enhancing techniques, such as dynamic
                loading and buffering, lead to considerable speed-up on-par with
                an idealised parallelisation of the process over 20 nodes.
                Conversely, while the cache-efficient structure-of-arrays
                collection yields a visible speed-up, other alternative data
                structures fail in fulfilling the theoretically-expected
                performance increase. This insight demonstrates the importance
                of good data alignment in memory and caches for Lagrangian
                physics simulations.

                Marine microplastics can be colonized by biofouling microbial
                organisms, leading to a decrease in microplastics' buoyancy. The
                sinking of biofouled microplastics could therefore represent a
                novel carbon export pathway within the ocean carbon cycle. Here,
                we model how microplastics are biofouled by diatoms, their
                consequent vertical motion due to buoyancy changes, and the
                interactions between particle-attached diatoms and carbon pools
                within the water column. We initialise our Lagrangian framework
                with biogeochemical data from NEMO-MEDUSA-2.0 and estimate the
                amount of organic carbon exported below 100 m depth starting
                from different surface concentrations of 1 mm microplastics. We
                focus on the Mediterranean Sea, that is characterized by some of
                the world’s highest microplastics concentrations and is a
                hotspot for biogeochemical changes induced by rising atmospheric
                carbon dioxide levels. Our results show that the carbon export
                caused by sinking biofouled microplastics is proportional to the
                concentration of microplastics in the sea surface layer, at
                least at modelled concentrations. We estimate that, while
                current concentrations of microplastics can modify the natural
                biological carbon export by less than 1%, future concentrations
                projected under business-as-usual pollution scenarios may lead
                to carbon exports up to 5% larger than the baseline (1998-2012)
                by 2050. Areas characterized by high primary productivity, i.e.,
                the western and central Mediterranean, are those where
                microplastics-mediated carbon export results to be highest.
                While highlighting the potential and quantitatively limited
                occurrence of this phenomenon in the Mediterranean Sea, our
                results call for further investigation of a
                microplastics-related carbon export pathway in the global ocean.

                To accurately predict the impacts of ocean acidification on
                shallow-water ecosystems, we must account for the biogeochemical
                impact of local benthic communities, as well as the connectivity
                between offshore and onshore water masses. Estimation of
                residence time can help quantify this connectivity and determine
                the degree to which the benthos can influence the chemistry of
                the overlying water column. We present estimates of nearshore
                residence time for Guam and utilize these estimates to model the
                effects of benthic ecosystem metabolism on the coral reef
                carbonate system. Control volume and particle tracking
                approaches were used to estimate nearshore residence time. These
                estimates were paired with observed patterns in the reef
                carbonate system around Guam using water samples collected by
                NOAA’s National Coral Reef Monitoring Program. Model performance
                results suggest that when considering the effects of benthic
                metabolism on the carbonate system, it is paramount to represent
                the contact time of the water volume with the benthos. Even
                coarse estimates of residence time significantly increase model
                skill. We observed the highest predictive skill in models
                including control volume derived estimates of residence time,
                but only when those estimates were included as an interaction
                with benthic composition. This work shows that not only is
                residence time critically important to better predict
                biogeochemical variability in coral reef environments, but that
                even coarse hydrodynamic models can provide useful residence
                time estimates at management relevant, whole-ecosystem scales.

                The simulation of Lagrangian drift is an important task in
                applications such as dispersion of pollutants, larvae and search
                and rescue activities. In this study, the Eulerian current,
                Stokes drift and wind effect on the simulation of observed
                drifters were analysed. The Lagrangian OceanParcels model was
                used, and the surface trajectories were assessed by comparison
                with 9 GPS drifter trajectories in the Gulf of Finland, Gulf of
                Riga and Lithuanian coast. The Normalised Cumulative Lagrangian
                Separation (NCLS) distance between the simulated and the
                satellite-tracked drifter trajectories, and the mean absolute
                error (MAE) were used as comparison metrics. The present study
                suggests the need to consider the Stokes drift and the wind
                factor in addition to the modelled Eulerian currents to obtain a
                better description of the trajectories of particles. By making
                these considerations, the OceanParcels model could adequately
                simulate particle trajectories in the sub-basins within the
                Baltic Sea. The realized model tests showed that motion of
                surface drifters are strongly controlled by the Stokes drift
                when the significant wave height is &gt;1 m, whereas the wind
                component and the Eulerian currents are crucial when the
                significant wave height is &lt;0.6 m or the wave (Stokes drift)
                directions do not match the wind direction.

                The Western INDian Ocean Simulation (WINDS) is a regional
                configuration of the Coastal and Regional Ocean Community Model
                (CROCO) for the southwestern Indian Ocean. WINDS has a
                horizontal resolution of 1/50∘ (∼2 km) and spans a latitudinal
                range of 23.5∘ S–0∘ N and a longitudinal range from the East
                African coast to 77.5∘ E. We ran two experiments using the WINDS
                configuration: WINDS-M, a full 28-year multidecadal run
                (1993–2020); and WINDS-C, a 10-year climatological control run
                with monthly climatological forcing. WINDS was primarily run for
                buoyant Lagrangian particle tracking applications, and
                horizontal surface velocities are output at a temporal
                resolution of 30 min. Other surface fields are output daily, and
                the full 3D temperature, salinity, and velocity fields are
                output every 5 d. We demonstrate that WINDS successfully manages
                to reproduce surface temperature, salinity, currents, and tides
                in the southwestern Indian Ocean, and it is therefore
                appropriate for use in regional marine dispersal studies for
                buoyant particles or other applications using high-resolution
                surface ocean properties.

                The Antarctic Slope Current (ASC) and Antarctic Coastal Current
                advect heat, freshwater, nutrients, and biological organisms
                westward around the Antarctic margin, providing a connective
                link between different sectors of the continental shelf. Yet the
                strength and pathways of connectivity around the continent, and
                the timescales of advection, remain poorly understood. We use
                daily velocity fields from a global high-resolution ocean-sea
                ice model, combined with Lagrangian particle tracking, to shed
                light on these timescales and improve our understanding of
                circumpolar connectivity around Antarctica. Virtual particles
                were released along vertical transects over the continental
                shelf every 5 days for a year and were tracked forward in time
                for 21 years. Analysis of the resulting particle trajectories
                highlights that the West Antarctic sector has widespread
                connectivity with all regions of the Antarctic shelf. Advection
                around the continent is typically rapid with peak transit times
                of 1–5 years for particles to travel 90° of longitude
                downstream. The ASC plays a key role in driving connectivity in
                East Antarctica and the Weddell Sea, while the Coastal Current
                controls connectivity in West Antarctica, the eastern Antarctic
                Peninsula, and along the continental shelf east of Prydz Bay.
                Connectivity around the shelf is impeded in two main locations,
                namely, the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula and Cape Adare in the
                Ross Sea, where significant export of water from the continental
                shelf is found. These findings help to understand the locations
                and timescales over which anomalies, such as meltwater from the
                Antarctic Ice Sheet, can be redistributed downstream.

                The Virgin Islands basin (VIB) includes several Marine Protected
                Areas (MPAs) of interest as biologically unique spawning
                aggregation sites. The ecological structure in and around these
                MPAs is regulated by several factors, including changes in
                near-surface water properties. Anomalously low near-surface
                salinity is observed in the VIB during April 2009/2011, and
                March 2010, with a salinity signature consistent with Amazon
                plume waters. Other low salinity events in the region are found
                during 2007 to 2017 using output from an ocean reanalysis. The
                reanalysis shows that horizontal salinity advection explains
                near-surface salinity variability in the VIB to a high degree,
                including events observed in the in-situ measurements. We use a
                Lagrangian Particle tracking model to track particles over the
                2007-2017 period and identify the source and pathways of water
                imports to the VIB. We describe three pathways. The northernmost
                one is often associated with advection of salty Atlantic waters.
                The two southernmost paths are associated with advection of low
                salinity waters from the Amazon into the VIB. The latter two
                pathways arrive to the Caribbean Sea as described in previous
                studies on low salinity advection to the wider Caribbean from
                the Amazon river: we find that once in the Caribbean Sea, the
                low salinity water makes its way into the VIB when steered
                northward by mesoscale features. This results in Amazon river
                waters regulating salinity variability in the VIB during
                April-November. During December-March, when mesoscale activity
                is at its minimum, the Atlantic inflow regulates the salinity
                variability within the VIB instead.

                Ocean currents are a key driver of plankton dispersal across the
                oceanic basins. However, species specific temperature
                constraints may limit the plankton dispersal. We propose a
                methodology to estimate the connectivity pathways and timescales
                for plankton species with given constraints on temperature
                tolerances, by combining Lagrangian modeling with network
                theory. We demonstrate application of two types of temperature
                constraints: thermal niche and adaptation potential and compare
                it to the surface water connectivity between sample stations in
                the Atlantic Ocean. We find that non-constrained passive
                particles representative of a plankton species can connect all
                the stations within three years at the surface with pathways
                mostly along the major ocean currents. However, under thermal
                constraints, only a subset of stations can establish
                connectivity. Connectivity time increases marginally under these
                constraints, suggesting that plankton can keep within their
                favorable thermal conditions by advecting via slightly longer
                paths. Effect of advection depth on connectivity is observed to
                be sensitive to the width of the thermal constraints, along with
                decreasing flow speeds with depth and possible changes in
                pathways.

                Vast quantities of debris are beaching at remote islands in the
                western Indian Ocean. We carry out marine dispersal simulations
                incorporating currents, waves, winds, beaching, and sinking, for
                both terrestrial and marine sources of debris, to predict where
                this debris comes from. Our results show that most terrestrial
                debris beaching at these remote western Indian Ocean islands
                drifts from Indonesia, India, and Sri Lanka. Debris associated
                with fisheries and shipping also poses a major risk. Debris
                accumulation at Seychelles is likely seasonal, peaking during
                February–April. This pattern is driven by monsoonal winds and
                may be amplified during positive Indian Ocean Dipole and El-Niño
                events. Our results underline the vulnerability of small island
                states to marine plastic pollution, and are a crucial step
                towards improved management of the issue. The trajectories used

                Physical forcings affect water exchange in coral reef atolls.
                Characteristics of the consequent water exchange depend on the
                atoll morphology and the local atmospheric and hydrographic
                conditions. The pattern of water exchange at the Dongsha atoll
                under the influences of tides, wind, and waves was investigated
                by conducting realistic modeling and numerical experiments. The
                analyses suggest that the southwestern wind could enhance the
                inflow transports at the southern reef flat and the outflow
                transports at the northern reef flat/north channel. The
                northeastern wind induces an inversed pattern. Unlike the wind,
                the waves always strengthen the inflow transports at the reef
                flat, and the locations of strengthened transports depend on the
                incident directions of the waves. Wind and waves induce shorter
                hydrodynamic time scales than tides, suggesting more vigorous
                water exchange during high wind and waves. The directions of
                wind and waves significantly affect the spatial distributions of
                the residence time and the age. This implies that the
                hydrodynamic processes in the Dongsha Atoll would have
                significant seasonal variability. This study presents different
                circulation patterns in an atoll system influenced by calm
                weather and strong wind/waves.

                This work describes the circulation over the continental slope
                and the São Paulo Plateau in the Santos Basin during the SANSED
                winter 2019 survey. The cruise consisted of four legs in the
                period between June, 11 and August, 03 2019. The observed
                circulation is dominated by the Atlantic southwestern boundary
                current regime and remotely-generated anticyclones and cyclones.
                The former is composed by the Brazil Current, the Intermediate
                Western Boundary Current and their mesoscale meanders; the
                latter are 300km vortical rings with origin in the eastern side
                of the South Atlantic Basin. A Lagrangian scheme applied over
                satellite altimeter maps indicate that the origin of these rings
                is primarily the Cape Basin of South Africa. The interaction
                between the boundary currents, their cyclonic meanders, and the
                anticyclonic rings is complex, and varies widely. During the
                SANSED winter 2019 survey period, three anticyclones interacted
                with the Brazil Current, instabilizing it, forming dipoles with
                the current cyclonic meanders, leading to their downstream
                propagation. Ancienter cyclonic eddies within Santos Basin may
                interfere with the propagation of the large anticyclones further
                south. In addition, the continuous arrival of
                remotely-originated anticyclones, the larger portion over the
                São Paulo Plateau presented a tendency of counter-clockwise
                circulation during the whole cruise period.

                Catch and distribution of tuna in the ocean are typically
                investigated with ocean basin-scale models. Due to their large
                scale, such models must greatly simplify tuna behaviour
                occurring at a scale below 100 km, despite interactions at this
                level potentially being important to both catch and distribution
                of tuna. For example, the associative behaviour of tuna with
                man-made floating objects, that are deployed by fishers to
                improve their catch rates (Fish Aggregating Devices; FADs), are
                usually ignored or simplified. Here we present a model that can
                be used to investigate the influence of tuna dynamics below the
                100 km scale on larger scales. It is an Individual-Based Model
                (IBM) of a hypothetical, tuna-like species, that includes their
                interactions with each other, free-floating FADs and prey. In
                this IBM, both tuna and FADs are represented by Lagrangian
                particles that are advected by an ocean flow field, with tuna
                also exhibiting active swimming based on internal states such as
                stomach fullness. We apply the IBM in multiple configurations of
                idealized flow and prey fields, alongside differing interaction
                strengths between agents. When tuna swimming behaviour is
                influenced equally by prey and FADs, we find that the model
                simulations compare well with observations at the km scale. For
                instance, compared to observations, tuna particles have a
                similar stomach fullness when associated or non-associated to a
                FAD, tuna colonize at similar timescales at FADs after their
                deployment and tuna particles exhibit similar variations in
                continuous residence times. However, we find large differences
                in emergent dynamics such as residence and catch among different
                flow configurations, because the flow determines the time scale
                at which tuna encounter FADs. These findings are discussed in
                the context of directing future research, and an improved
                interpretation of tuna catch and other data for the sustainable
                management of these economically important species.

                Agulhas leakage, the transport of warm and salty waters from the
                Indian Ocean into the South Atlantic, has been suggested to
                increase under anthropogenic climate change, due to
                strengthening Southern Hemisphere westerly winds. The resulting
                enhanced salt transport into the South Atlantic may counteract
                the projected weakening of the Atlantic overturning circulation
                through warming and ice melting. Here we combine existing and
                new observation- and model-based Agulhas leakage estimates to
                robustly quantify its decadal evolution since the 1960s. We find
                that Agulhas leakage very likely increased between the mid-1960s
                and mid-1980s, in agreement with strengthening winds. Our models
                further suggest that increased leakage was related to enhanced
                transport outside eddies and coincided with strengthened
                Atlantic overturning circulation. Yet, it appears unlikely that
                Agulhas leakage substantially increased since the 1990s, despite
                continuously strengthening winds. Our results stress the need to
                better understand decadal leakage variability to detect and
                predict anthropogenic trends.

                The ocean is an important part of the global system. Tracking
                the connectivity between bodies of water is crucial for
                understanding local, regional and global changes in the ocean
                dynamics that mediate the spreading of nutrients and influence
                the marine ecosystem and ocean productivity. We developed a Data
                Fusion approach that enhances and automates the existing methods
                for the analysis of this connectivity. This approach combines
                and condenses two different data sources in two stages, Data
                Enhancement followed by Data Reduction. The Data Enhancement
                stage fuses equidistantly gridded data containing physical
                measurements and trajectories representing movement data. The
                Data Reduction stage aggregates the fused data into a Markov
                Model representation of the transition probabilities between
                ocean regions. We applied this framework to an exemplary
                analysis for the connectivity between two oceanic areas using
                real ocean data stemming from marine research. We show that this
                method directly tackles the limitations of existing marine data
                analysis methods and furthermore introduces new means to answer
                questions that had no quantitative answers up to now.

                The fluid dynamics planet Saturn gives rise to alternating
                east–west jet streams, large cyclonic and anticyclonic vortices,
                and a dipole-dominant magnetic field that is highly axisymmetric
                about the planetary rotation axis. Modeling these features in a
                self-consistent manner is crucial for understanding the dynamics
                of Saturn's interior and atmosphere. Here we report a turbulent
                high-resolution dynamo simulation in a spherical shell that
                produces these features simultaneously for the first time. A
                crucial model ingredient is a long-hypothesized stably
                stratified layer (SSL), sandwiched between a deep metallic
                hydrogen layer and an outer low-conductivity molecular layer,
                born out of the limited solubility of helium inside metallic
                hydrogen at certain depths. The model spontaneously produces
                polar cyclones and significant low-latitude and midlatitude jet
                stream activity in the molecular layer. The off-equatorial
                low-latitude jet streams partially penetrate into the SSL and
                interact with the magnetic field. This helps to axisymmetrize

                the poloidal magnetic field to a toroidal field, which appears
                as two global magnetic energy rings surrounding the deeper

                Our model highlights the role of an SSL in shaping the fluid
                dynamical and magnetic features of giant planets, as exemplified
                at Saturn.

                Plastic pollution has been reported in the North Atlantic Ocean
                since the 1970s, yet limited data over subsequent decades pose
                challenges when assessing spatio-temporal trends in relation to
                global leakages and intervention strategies. This study
                quantified microplastics within the upper ocean along a
                longitudinal transect of the North Atlantic and its subtropical
                gyre. Microplastics were sampled from surface and subsurface
                (−25 m) water using a manta trawl and NIKSIN bottle
                respectively. The surface water polymer community varied
                significantly between geographic positions (‘inshore’, ‘gyre’,
                ‘open ocean’), and was significantly influenced by fragment
                quantity. Compared to other positions, the North Atlantic gyre
                was associated with high concentrations of polyethylene,
                polypropylene, acrylic and polyamide fragments. Subsurface water
                was dominated by polyamide and polyester fibres. Backtracked
                2-year Lagrangian simulations illustrated connectivity patterns.
                Continued monitoring of microplastics throughout the water
                column of the North Atlantic Ocean is required to address
                knowledge gaps and assess spatio-temporal trends.

                The North Pacific armorhead (NPA), Pentaceros wheeleri, is
                thought to exhibit an extended post-spawning epipelagic phase in
                which larvae disperse to the northeast Pacific Ocean. Current
                understanding of juvenile distribution, development, and
                mechanisms that drive recruitment variation, however, remains
                largely incomplete. The objective of this study was to compare a
                time series of NPA recruitment to established climate indices
                and to environmental covariates to explore drivers of the NPA
                life cycle. Additionally, this work investigates potential
                larval NPA transport pathways and their positional relationships
                to the proposed northeastern nursery grounds. Using Lagrangian
                particle tracking, trajectories of passive larvae were simulated
                at depths of 0 and 15m for 18years (2001–2018) from the Southern
                Emperor-Northern Hawaiian Ridge (SE-NHR) natal habitat.
                Dispersal distances and particle end positions were examined for
                their potential relationships with recruitment. Sea surface
                temperature and net primary productivity were evaluated as
                predictor variables using generalized additive modeling. Neither
                regression of particle end-point characteristics nor
                environmental covariates resulted in significant correlations
                with recruitment here, perhaps owing to data limitations
                surrounding the nursery zone. Particles were found to be
                advected largely within the North Pacific transition zone in the
                central north Pacific. Significant seasonal correlations were
                found between recruitment and the Arctic Oscillation, Pacific
                Decadal Oscillation and North Pacific Gyre Oscillation,
                suggesting that NPA recruitment mechanisms respond to
                interannual ocean-atmospheric climate oscillations. Better
                knowledge of the connections between recruitment and the
                environment would be valuable for stock management, and
                improvements for advection predictions are discussed.

                Large amounts of plastic discharging from rivers in Java and
                Bali can potentially pollute many fishing areas in Indonesia. To
                identify strategies to mitigate this problem, it is important to
                understand the pathways and destinations of this marine debris.
                Therefore, the pathways and destinations of debris discharging
                from 10 major Java and Bali rivers were investigated using a
                Lagrangian particle tracking model. The amount of floating
                plastic discharging from each river was determined by the
                population in each river catchment area, the Mismanaged Plastic
                Waste ratio, and precipitation. Our study demonstrated that
                plastic debris pathways in Java and Bali primarily follow
                surface currents and are secondarily driven by wind toward the
                Indian Ocean. Around Indonesia, the prevailing monsoonal
                circulation plays an important role in determining the
                destination of floating debris. A larger amount of debris was
                discharged into the seas around Indonesia during the northwest
                winter monsoon when the precipitation rate was higher, leading
                to a considerable accumulation of debris in various Indonesian
                fisheries management areas. The areas most affected were
                Southern Java, Western Sumatra, and the Banda Sea in descending
                order. The most effect way of reducing the debris over Southern
                Java was reducing mismanaged plastic over Yogyakarta, Banten,
                and Bali provinces or along Progo River.

                Microplastic particles move three-dimensionally through the
                ocean, but modeling studies often do not consider size-dependent
                vertical transport processes. In addition, microplastic
                fragmentation in ocean environments remains poorly understood,
                despite fragments making up the majority of microplastic
                pollution in terms of the number of particles and despite its
                potential role in mass removal. Here, we first investigate the
                role of particle size and density on the large-scale transport
                of microplastics in the Mediterranean Sea and next analyze how
                fragmentation may affect transport and mass loss of plastics.
                For progressively smaller particle sizes, microplastics are
                shown to be less likely to be beached and more likely to reach
                open water. Smaller particles also generally get mixed deeper,
                resulting in lower near-surface concentrations of small
                particles despite their higher total abundance. Microplastic
                fragmentation is shown to be dominated by beach-based
                fragmentation, with ocean-based fragmentation processes likely
                having negligible influence. However, fragmentation remains a
                slow process acting on decadal time scales and as such likely
                does not have a major influence on the large-scale distribution
                of microplastics and mass loss over periods less than 3 years.

                The Galapagos Marine Reserve was established in 1986 to ensure
                protection of the islands' unique biodiversity. Unfortunately,
                the islands are polluted by marine plastic debris and the island
                authorities face the challenge to effectively remove plastic
                from its shorelines due to limited resources. To optimise
                efforts, we have identified the most effective cleanup locations
                on the Galapagos Islands using network theory. A network is
                constructed from a Lagrangian simulation describing the flow of
                macroplastic between the various islands within the Galapagos
                Marine Reserve, where the nodes represent locations along the
                coastline and the edges the likelihood for plastic to travel
                from one location and beach at another. We have found four
                network centralities that provide the best coastline ranking to
                optimise the cleanup effort based on various impact metrics. In
                particular locations with a high retention rate are favourable
                for cleanup. The results indicate that using the most effective
                centrality for finding cleanup locations is a good strategy for
                heavily polluted regions if the distribution of marine plastic
                debris on the coastlines is unknown and limited cleanup
                resources are available.

                The North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) is a crucial component of
                the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation and is therefore
                an important factor of the climate system. In order to estimate
                the mean relative contributions, sources, and pathways of the
                NADW at the southern exit of the Labrador Sea, a Lagrangian
                particle experiment is performed. The particles were seeded
                according to the strength of the velocity field along the 53∘N
                section and traced 40 years backward in time in the
                three-dimensional velocity and hydrography field. The resulting
                transport pathways, their sources and corresponding transit
                timescales were inferred. Our experiment shows that, of the
                30.1Sv of NADW passing 53∘N on average, the majority of this
                water is associated with a diapycnal mass flux without contact
                to the atmosphere, accounting for 14.3Sv (48%), where 6.2Sv
                originate from the Labrador Sea, compared to 4.7Sv from the
                Irminger Sea. The second-largest contribution originates from
                the mixed layer with 7.2Sv (24%), where the Labrador Sea
                contribution (5.9Sv) dominates over the Irminger Sea
                contribution (1.0Sv). Another 5.7Sv (19%) of NADW crosses the
                Greenland–Scotland Ridge within the NADW density class, where
                about two-thirds pass the Denmark Strait, while one-third
                crosses the Iceland–Scotland Ridge. The NADW exported at 53∘N is
                hence dominated by entrainment through the diapycnal mass flux
                and mixed-layer origin in the Labrador Sea.

                Output from a high-resolution ocean model, a wind reanalysis and
                a particle tracking tool are used to improve our understanding
                of the shelf circulation in an embayment off South Africa's east
                coast, known as the KwaZulu-Natal Bight. This region spans
                across roughly 140 km of coastline and is located between 29°S
                and 30°S. It is influenced by the strong, south-westward flowing
                Agulhas Current on its offshore edge, while its shelf is
                dominated by weak and variable currents. On the KwaZulu-Natal
                Bight's shelf, realistic high-resolution model simulations
                indicate the presence of a mean north-eastward flow: the Natal
                Bight Coastal Counter-Current. The mean surface circulation
                depicts a Natal Bight Coastal Counter Current stretching along
                the 50 m isobath from the southern to the northern section of
                the KwaZulu-Natal Bight while progressively becoming narrower
                and weaker northwards. The mean vertical structure of this
                counter current extends throughout the water column and at its
                origin, it almost connects with the Agulhas Undercurrent. In
                this region, the Natal Bight Coastal Counter-Current is about 20
                km wide and has an average speed of 20 cm/s at its core, which
                may exceed 100 cm/s during individual events. The passage of
                southward propagating anticyclonic eddies offshore of the
                Agulhas Current are associated with a southward flow along the
                southern KwaZulu-Natal Bight region and the interruption of the
                otherwise north-eastward shelf currents. While the circulation
                in the KwaZulu-Natal Bight is primarily driven by perturbations
                at the Agulhas Current front, there is also some indication of a
                direct wind-driven influence in coastal waters, inshore of the
                50 m isobath and north of 29.5°S. Virtual particle tracking
                experiments show that the Natal Bight Coastal Counter Current
                may increase connectivity between Marine Protected Areas within
                the KwaZulu-Natal Bight, where the current greatly increases the
                water retention. This may trap nutrients from coastal origins on
                the shelf, together with any suspended particles such as larvae.
                Therefore, the Natal Bight Coastal Counter-Current has the
                potential to increase the suitability of this habitat for larval
                settlement.

                Larval dispersal and connectivity have important implications
                for fisheries management, especially for species with life
                cycles influenced by ocean boundary currents. Giant Mud Crab
                (Scylla serrata) and Blue Swimmer Crab (Portunus armatus) are
                two estuarine portunid crabs (Family: Portunidae) that support
                significant commercial and recreational harvest in eastern
                Australia. Giant Mud Crab migrate to coastal waters to spawn,
                and while Blue Swimmer Crab spawn primarily within estuaries
                they occasionally migrate to coastal waters to spawn, followed
                by larval dispersal in the East Australian Current (EAC). Here,
                we coupled a high-resolution oceanographic model with a
                Lagrangian particle tracking framework to simulate larval
                dispersal and determine the extent of population connectivity in
                this region. Our simulations indicate broad-scale connectivity
                (~40–400 km), characterised by high inter-estuary connectivity.
                Overall, our results suggest a north-to-south source-sink
                structure for both species, with contributions of particles from
                the north ranging from 51% to 99%. Recruitment to a given
                estuary is dependent on the proximity of mesoscale oceanographic
                features of the EAC. Most notably, the EAC separation acts as a
                barrier to recruitment between spawning and settlement to the
                north/south of this region. This significantly limits
                interjurisdictional connectivity for these species, especially
                Blue Swimmer Crab, likely due to a shorter pelagic larval
                duration than Giant Mud Crab. Our results provide evidence to
                inform the assessment and management of these species.

                Context: The spanner crab (Ranina ranina) stock of eastern
                Australia is distributed across two state jurisdictions and, as
                a non-migratory species with a pelagic larval phase,
                connectivity within this stock is likely to occur by larval
                dispersal, driven by ocean currents. Aims: To understand
                connectivity and patterns of larval supply in the eastern
                Australian spanner crab stock. Methods: Lagrangian particle
                tracking methods were used to simulate larval transport around
                the key spanner crab fishing regions in eastern Australia. Key
                results: Spawning off central Queensland (Qld) supplies a large
                proportion of recruits, supporting both the Qld and New South
                Wales (NSW) fisheries. Lagged larval settlement showed
                significant correlations to catch-per-unit-effort and the
                proportion of total harvest taken within the NSW fishery,
                providing evidence to suggest that the NSW fishery may be
                reliant on spawning activity in Queensland. Conclusions: The Qld
                and NSW fisheries are highly connected and the broad-scale
                patterns identified by the current modelling approach could
                provide an indicator of potentially good or bad recruitment
                years, particularly as finer resolution, and refined
                reproductive biology knowledge on spanner crabs becomes
                available. Implications: The Qld and NSW fisheries are highly
                connected with a source–sink structure and it is recommended
                that a co-management strategy be adopted.

                Lagrangian flow data in oceanography are highly complex,
                encompassing not only the underpinning Eulerian, advective,
                vectorial flow fields and the three-dimensional position
                coordinates of tracer particles but also supplementary
                trajectory information such as interaction radii of particles,
                lifecycle source-to-sink information and biochemical process
                data. Visualising all those data cooperatively in its
                three-dimensional context is a prime challenge, as it demands to
                present all relevant information to enable a contextual analysis

                perceptual issues of clutter, colourisation conflicts, artefacts
                and the lack of spatial references in fluid-flow applications.
                In this article, we present visualisation design approaches for
                4D spatio-temporal data in their context and introduce a novel
                colour-mapping approach for 3D velocity tensors. The employed

                on an oceanographic case study. The technical and perceptual
                elements have further implications and applications for
                still-picture and animated volumetric visualisation design in
                related applications of the natural sciences, such as geological
                flow mapping.

                Model simulations of past climates are increasingly found to
                compare well with proxy data at a global scale, but regional
                discrepancies remain. A persistent issue in modeling past
                greenhouse climates has been the temperature difference between
                equatorial and (sub-)polar regions, which is typically much
                larger in simulations than proxy data suggest. Particularly in
                the Eocene, multiple temperature proxies suggest extreme warmth
                in the southwest Pacific Ocean, where model simulations
                consistently suggest temperate conditions. Here, we present new
                global ocean model simulations at 0.1° horizontal resolution for
                the middle-late Eocene. The eddies in the high-resolution model
                affect poleward heat transport and local time-mean flow in
                critical regions compared to the noneddying flow in the standard
                low-resolution simulations. As a result, the high-resolution
                simulations produce higher surface temperatures near Antarctica
                and lower surface temperatures near the equator compared to the
                low-resolution simulations, leading to better correspondence
                with proxy reconstructions. Crucially, the high-resolution
                simulations are also much more consistent with biogeographic
                patterns in endemic-Antarctic and low-latitude-derived plankton,
                and thus resolve the long-standing discrepancy of warm subpolar
                ocean temperatures and isolating polar gyre circulation. The
                results imply that strongly eddying model simulations are
                required to reconcile discrepancies between regional proxy data
                and models, and demonstrate the importance of accurate regional
                paleobathymetry for proxy-model comparisons.

                An accurate representation of physical and biological processes
                is crucial to resolve larval dispersal pathways and characterize
                connectivity of coral reef ecosystems. We investigate how
                hydrodynamic forcings drive larval retention rates during the
                bi-annual mass coral spawning of the coral genus Acropora within
                a coral reef atoll (Mermaid Reef), located off northwestern
                Australia. By analyzing hydrodynamic conditions during 41yr of
                historical spring and autumn coral spawning events, we identify
                typical and extreme hydrodynamic forcing conditions. Particle
                tracking using the output from a fine-scale coupled wave-flow
                hydrodynamic model forced with typical hydrodynamic conditions
                during coral spawning, revealed a mean transport of larvae
                eastward across the atoll. Transport was mainly driven by a
                combination of wave and tidal currents, where the residual tidal
                flow and unidirectional wave flow increased the net export of
                particles, and the oscillatory tidal (non-residual) flow reduced
                the net export of particles from the reef. Importantly, however,
                numerical simulations forced with extreme hydrodynamic
                conditions generated by episodic tropical cyclones (11 out of
                41yr) showed large deviations from the typical eastward flow
                during autumn spawning, generating different connectivity
                pathways within the reef. Considering the substantial time
                larvae can be retained within reef systems, overlooking
                fine-scale hydrodynamic processes may greatly overestimate
                larval transport distances between adjacent coral reef atolls.
                As a result, we emphasize the need to consider fine-scale
                hydrodynamic processes within regional connectivity predictions,
                which is generally not considered yet critical to understand the
                capacity of reefs to recover following disturbances.

                Microbes play a primary role in aquatic ecosystems and
                biogeochemical cycles. Spatial patchiness is a critical factor
                underlying these activities, influencing biological
                productivity, nutrient cycling and dynamics across trophic
                levels. Incorporating spatial dynamics into microbial models is
                a long-standing challenge, particularly where small-scale
                turbulence is involved. Here, we combine a fully 3D direct
                numerical simulation of convective mixed layer turbulence, with
                an individual-based microbial model to test the key hypothesis
                that the coupling of gyrotactic motility and turbulence drives
                intense microscale patchiness. The fluid model simulates
                turbulent convection caused by heat loss through the fluid
                surface, for example during the night, during autumnal or winter
                cooling or during a cold-air outbreak. We find that under such
                conditions, turbulence-driven patchiness is depth-structured and
                requires high motility: Near the fluid surface, intense
                convective turbulence overpowers motility, homogenising motile
                and non-motile microbes approximately equally. At greater depth,
                in conditions analogous to a thermocline, highly motile microbes
                can be over twice as patch-concentrated as non-motile microbes,
                and can substantially amplify their swimming velocity by
                efficiently exploiting fast-moving packets of fluid. Our results
                substantiate the predictions of earlier studies, and demonstrate
                that turbulence-driven patchiness is not a ubiquitous
                consequence of motility but rather a delicate balance of
                motility and turbulent intensity.

                Most marine plastic pollution originates on land. However, once
                plastic is at sea, it is difficult to determine its origin. Here
                we present a Bayesian inference framework to compute the
                probability that a piece of plastic found at sea came from a
                particular source. This framework combines information about
                plastic emitted by rivers with a Lagrangian simulation, and
                yields maps indicating the probability that a particle sampled
                somewhere in the ocean originates from a particular river
                source. We showcase the framework for floating river-sourced
                plastic released into the South Atlantic Ocean. We computed the
                probability as a function of the particle age at three
                locations, showing how probabilities vary according to the
                location and age. We computed the source probability of beached
                particles, showing that plastic found at a given latitude is
                most likely to come from the closest river source. This
                framework lays the basis for source attribution of marine
                plastic.

                We study the peculiar motion of inertial solid particles across
                stratified turbulent/non-turbulent interfaces (STNTI). Previous
                studies in quiescent stratified layers demonstrated that
                inertial particles slow down substantially due to an additional
                force term related to the stratification. Here we report for the
                first time a similar effect on inertial particles moving across
                a two-layer STNTI of finite thickness. This problem is addressed
                both experimentally and numerically: we utilize the
                three-dimensional particle tracking velocimetry (3D-PTV) in a
                index-matched STNTI experiment under an oscillating grid, and
                two direct numerical simulation (DNS) cases of STNTI. The DNSs
                test the effects of different turbulent forcings on inertial
                spheres in the turbulent layer and across STNTI and extends the
                parameter ranges of Reynolds and Froude numbers unfeasible in
                the experiments. Turbulence is produced in the DNSs using a
                convective forcing (heat source at the domain boundary) in one
                case, and a forcing that mimics a vertically oscillating grid in
                the other. The numerical spheres are tracked, through one-way
                coupling approach, using a modified Basset–Boussinesq–Oseen
                equation which includes a stratification-induced term. The
                stratification force is modelled as an additional buoyancy of a
                caudal wake with varying density. This algorithm creates
                Lagrangian trajectories that resemble the motion of inertial
                particles across stratified interfaces in quiescent and
                turbulent experiments. Furthermore, numerical results for the
                STNTI cases help to distinguish the essential features observed
                in the experiments that are caused by stratification from those
                that relate to turbulence–particle interactions.

                The North Atlantic Ocean is a key region for carbon
                sequestration by the biological carbon pump (BCP). The quantity
                of organic carbon exported from the surface, the region and
                depth at which it is remineralized, and the subsequent timescale
                of ventilation (return of the remineralized carbon back into
                contact with the atmosphere), control the magnitude of BCP
                sequestration. Carbon stored in the ocean for &gt;100 years is
                assumed to be sequestered for climate-relevant timescales. We
                apply Lagrangian tracking to an ocean circulation and marine
                biogeochemistry model to determine the fate of North Atlantic
                organic carbon export. Organic carbon assumed to undergo
                remineralization at each of three vertical horizons (500, 1,000,
                and 2,000 m) is tracked to determine how much remains out of
                contact with the atmosphere for 100 years. The fraction that
                remains below the mixed layer for 100 years is defined as the
                sequestration efficiency (SEff) of remineralized exported
                carbon. For exported carbon remineralized at the 500, 1,000 and
                2,000 m horizons, the SEff is 28%, 66% and 94%, respectively.
                Calculating the amount of carbon sequestered using depths ≤1,000
                m, and not accounting for downstream ventilation, overestimates
                100-year carbon sequestration by at least 39%. This work has
                implications for the accuracy of future carbon sequestration
                estimates, which may be overstated, and for carbon management
                strategies (e.g., oceanic carbon dioxide removal and Blue Carbon
                schemes) that require long-term sequestration to be successful.

                Recently, a number of authors have used global particle tracking
                simulations to identify the effect that different surface
                currents have on marine litter accumulation, including the role
                of surface waves through the Stokes drift. However, in the
                upper-ocean boundary layer and in the presence of the Coriolis
                force, a wave-driven Eulerian flow forms that must be
                superimposed onto the Stokes drift in order to obtain the
                correct Lagrangian velocity. Taking into account both the
                Coriolis–Stokes force and the surface wave stress, Higgins,
                Vanneste, and van den Bremer (2020) derived an expression for
                this unsteady wave-driven Eulerian-mean flow in the form of a
                convolution between the Stokes drift and the so-called
                Ekman–Stokes kernel. In this paper, we apply this Ekman–Stokes
                kernel to generate a 12-year global hindcast of the wave-driven
                Eulerian current and show that its inclusion in particle
                tracking simulations has a significant effect on the
                distribution of small floating marine litter, such as
                microplastics. Using Lagrangian simulations, we find that the
                wave-driven Eulerian current is sensitive to the value of
                viscosity but generally opposes the dispersive behaviour of the
                Stokes drift, reducing the amount of cross-Equator particle
                transport and transport to the polar regions, resulting in
                closer agreement between modelled and observed microplastic
                distributions.

                Ichthyoplankton assemblages in the south central Tyrrhenian Sea
                are not known in spite of this being an intensely fished area.
                There are two large canyons in this region: Dohrn, in the Gulf
                of Naples, and Cuma, at the south end of the Gulf of Gaeta. In
                this study, we provide the first description of summer
                ichthyoplankton assemblages in the vicinity of the two canyons
                and present the physical features and Lagrangian particle
                tracking analyses at the time of the sampling. We identified
                fish larvae of 19 families and fish eggs of 8 families. The most
                abundant species was Engraulis encrasicolus, which was found at
                densities comparable to other known spawning grounds of the
                western Mediterranean. Mesopelagic species, such as
                Gonostomatidae and Myctophidae, were also abundant, especially
                at the Cuma Canyon. The notochord and standard length of the E.
                encrasicolus larvae ranged from 2.06 to 10.47mm and was
                significantly smaller at the Cuma stations than at the Dohrn
                stations, suggesting the presence of sub-populations with
                different spawning phenologies. The passive particle tracking
                analyses and the examination of currents confirmed distinct
                circulation features between the two sampled regions and in
                relation to depth and proximity to the canyon heads. These
                results uncover previously unknown rich assemblages of fish eggs
                and larvae and have conservation and management implications
                given the proximity of these canyons to a marine protected area
                and to an intensely fished continental shelf.

                Retention is a key driver of biological productivity near the
                coast since increased concentrations of planktonic particles in
                retention hotspots boost local primary production, availability
                of particulate food and larval recruitment. Known retention
                sites, such as bays, are also places where anthropogenic
                pressures accumulate in the form of pollution, harmful algal
                blooms, fisheries, aquaculture and port developments. In the
                face of these growing hazards, South African bays were recently
                declared ‘threatened’ priority sites for enhanced conservation
                and marine spatial planning (MSP). Multidisciplinary studies
                that spatially relate human impacts to physical features (such
                as retention patterns) and ecological processes (such as primary
                production) are valuable in this context. This study made use of
                a high resolution CROCO (Coastal and Regional Ocean Community
                Model) model along with the Parcels particle-tracking tool to
                develop a spatio-temporal coastal retention index (CORE) for the
                South African coastal ocean. To explore links between retention,
                biological productivity and anthropogenic impacts, a monthly
                time series of CORE (2001–2012) was evaluated in relation to
                satellite-derived coastal chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) and an index of
                cumulative human pressure. CORE showed variable temporal
                relationships with Chl-a among different subregions, however,
                when integrated over time, their spatial trends and peaks
                commonly aligned. This was most obvious on the south coast,
                where retention, Chl-a and human pressures peaked in the
                majority of bays that characterise this region. In the case of
                St Helena Bay on the west coast, CORE failed to represent a
                prominent retentive feature associated with upwelling, due to
                rapid alongshore advection of particles outside the 25-km
                retention radius of CORE. Despite this limitation, CORE provided
                profound insight into the variability of the coastal circulation
                around South Africa and its coupling with other socio-ecological
                variables. By contributing a novel data layer for MSP, CORE
                assists the integrated coastal management of bay ecosystems that
                face the hazards of multiple destructive uses.

                The equatorial retroflection of the North Brazil Current (NBC)
                into the Equatorial Undercurrent (EUC) and its posterior
                tropical recirculation is a major regulator for the returning
                limb of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC).
                Indeed, most surface and thermocline NBC waters retroflect at
                the equator all the way into the central and eastern Atlantic
                Ocean, before they recirculate back through the tropics to the
                western boundary. Here we use cruise data in the western
                equatorial Atlantic during April 2010 and reanalysis time series
                for the equatorial and tropical waters in both hemispheres in
                order to explore the recirculation pathways and transport
                variability. During the 1998-2016 period, the annual-mean EUC
                transports 15.1 ± 1.3 Sv at 32{degree sign}W, with 2.8 ± 0.4 Sv
                from the North Atlantic and 11.4 ± 1.3 Sv from the South
                Atlantic. Most of the total EUC transport comes from the western
                boundary retroflection south of 3{degree sign}N (7.2 ± 0.9 Sv)
                and a substantial fraction retroflects north of 3{degree sign}N
                (5.1 ± 0.4 Sv). The South Atlantic Subtropical waters feed the
                EUC at all thermocline depths while the North Atlantic and South
                Atlantic tropical waters do so at the surface and
                upper-thermocline levels. The EUC transport has a pronounced
                seasonality, with spring and fall maxima and a range of 8.8 Sv.
                The 18-year of reanalysis data shows a weak yet significant
                correlation with an Atlantic Niño index, and also suggests an
                enhanced contribution from the South Atlantic tropical waters
                during 2008-2016 as compared with 1997-2007.

                The fate of (micro)plastic particles in the open ocean is
                controlled by biological and physical processes. Here, we model
                the effects of biofouling on the subsurface vertical
                distribution of spherical, virtual plastic particles with radii
                of 0.01-1 mm. The biological specifications include the
                attachment, growth and loss of algae on particles. The physical
                specifications include four vertical velocity terms: advection,
                wind-driven mixing, tidally-induced mixing, and the sinking
                velocity of the biofouled particle. We track 10,000 particles
                for one year in three different regions with distinct biological
                and physical properties: the low productivity region of the
                North Pacific Subtropical Gyre, the high productivity region of
                the Equatorial Pacific and the high mixing region of the
                Southern Ocean. The growth of biofilm mass in the euphotic zone
                and loss of mass below the euphotic zone result in the
                oscillatory behaviour of particles, where the larger (0.1-1.0
                mm) particles have much shorter average oscillation lengths
                (&lt;10 days; 90th percentile) than the smaller (0.01-0.1 mm)
                particles (up to 130 days; 90th percentile). A subsurface
                maximum particle concentration occurs just below the mixed layer
                depth (around 30 m) in the Equatorial Pacific, which is most
                pronounced for larger particles (0.1-1.0 mm). This occurs since
                particles become neutrally buoyant when the processes affecting
                the settling velocity of a particle and the seawater's vertical
                movement are in equilibrium. Seasonal effects in the subtropical
                gyre result in particles sinking below the mixed layer depth
                only during spring blooms, but otherwise remaining within the
                mixed layer. The strong winds and deepest average mixed layer
                depth in the Southern Ocean (400 m) result in the deepest
                redistribution of particles (&gt;5000 m). Our results show that
                the vertical movement of particles is mainly affected by
                physical (wind-induced mixing) processes within the mixed layer
                and biological (biofilm) dynamics below the mixed layer.
                Furthermore, positively buoyant particles with radii of 0.01-1.0
                mm can sink far below the euphotic zone and mixed layer in
                regions with high near-surface mixing or high biological
                activity. This work can easily be coupled to other models to
                simulate open-ocean biofouling dynamics, in order to reach a
                better understanding of where ocean (micro)plastic ends up.

                these mechanisms in the SIO salinity maxima region. Using a
                Lagrangian approach, we estimated the monthly evolution of the
                subduction rate. A maximum subduction rate of 35–38 m/mon occurs
                during September and consequently decreases towards the end of
                the year. The effective subduction rate in the salinity maxima
                region shows the dominance of temporal induction (mixed layer
                tendency) term, with a sharp gradient in total subduction rate
                along the 30∘S associated with large mixed layer depth
                variation. Further, a high Turner angle (&gt;66∘) to the south
                of 30∘S confirms the generation of spiciness by injection
                mechanism. We found that the decrease in mixed layer salt (MLS)
                coincides with the increase in salinity below the mixed layer.
                To explore the significance of MLS changes in spiciness
                generation, we further addressed the monthly evolution of
                spiciness through MLS budget. Our results suggest that the
                entrainment and meridional advection terms are key to monthly
                variations in MLS changes and thus the spiciness.

                Ocean eddies play an important role in the transport and mixing
                processes of the ocean due to their ability to transport
                material, heat, salt, and other tracers across large distances.
                They exhibit at least two timescales: an Eulerian lifetime
                associated with persistent identifiable signatures in gridded
                fields such as vorticity or sea-surface height and multiple
                Lagrangian or material coherence timescales that are typically
                much shorter. We propose a method to study the
                multiple-timescale material transport, leakage, and entrainment
                by eddies with their surroundings by constructing sequences of
                finite-time coherent sets, computed as superlevel sets of
                dominant eigenfunctions of dynamic Laplace operators. The
                dominant eigenvalues of dynamic Laplace operators defined on
                time intervals of varying length allows us to identify a maximal
                coherence timescale that minimizes the rate of mass loss over a
                domain per unit flow time. We apply the method to examine the
                persistence and material coherence of an Agulhas ring, an ocean
                eddy in the South Atlantic ocean, using particle trajectories
                derived from a 0.1∘ global numerical ocean simulation. Using a
                sequence of sliding windows, the method is able to identify and
                track a persistent eddy feature for a time much longer than the
                maximal coherence timescale and with considerably larger
                material transport than the corresponding eddy feature
                identified from purely Eulerian information. Furthermore, the
                median residence times of fluid in the identified feature far
                exceed the timescale over which fully material motion is
                guaranteed. Through residence time calculations, we find that
                this particular eddy does not exhibit a long-lived coherent
                inner core and that the bulk of material transport is performed
                by the quasi-coherent outer ring of the eddy.

                Turbulent mixing is a vital component of vertical particulate
                transport, but ocean global circulation models (OGCMs) generally
                have low resolution representations of near-surface mixing.
                Furthermore, turbulence data is often not provided in OGCM model
                output. We present 1D parametrizations of wind-driven turbulent
                mixing in the ocean surface mixed layer, which are designed to
                be easily included in 3D Lagrangian model experiments.
                Stochastic transport is computed by Markov-0 or Markov-1 models,
                and we discuss the advantages/disadvantages of two vertical
                profiles for the vertical diffusion coefficient Kz. All vertical
                diffusion profiles and stochastic transport models lead to
                stable concentration profiles for buoyant particles, which for
                particles with rise velocities of 0.03 and 0.003 m/s agree
                relatively well with concentration profiles from field
                measurements of microplastics when Langmuir-circulation-driven
                turbulence is accounted for. Markov-0 models provide good model
                performance for integration timesteps of dt = 30 seconds, and
                can be readily applied in studying the behaviour of buoyant
                particulates in the ocean. Markov-1 models do not consistently
                improve model performance relative to Markov-0 models, and
                require an additional parameter that is poorly constrained.

                Coastlines potentially harbor a large part of litter entering
                the oceans such as plastic waste. The relative importance of the
                physical processes that influence the beaching of litter is
                still relatively unknown. Here, we investigate the beaching of
                litter by analyzing a data set of litter gathered along the
                Dutch North Sea coast during extensive beach cleanup efforts
                between the years 2014-2019. This data set is unique in the
                sense that data is gathered consistently over various years by
                many volunteers (a total of 14,000), on beaches which are quite
                similar in substrate (sandy). This makes the data set valuable
                to identify which environmental variables play an important role
                in the beaching process, and to explore the variability of beach
                litter concentrations. We investigate this by fitting a random
                forest machine learning regression model to the observed litter
                concentrations. We find that especially tides play an important
                role, where an increasing tidal variability and tidal height
                lead to less litter found on beaches. Relatively straight and
                exposed coastlines appear to accumulate more litter. The
                regression model indicates that transport of litter through the
                marine environment is also important in explaining beach litter
                variability. By understanding which processes cause the
                accumulation of litter on the coast, recommendations can be
                given for more effective removal of litter from the marine
                environment, such as organizing beach cleanups during low tides
                at exposed coastlines. We estimate that 16,500-31,200 kilograms
                (95% confidence interval) of litter are located on the 365
                kilometers of Dutch North Sea coastline.

                In the eastern Alboran Sea, frontogenesis (FG) is a dominant
                process for fronts extending from the Spanish coast toward the
                basin interior, promoting large vertical displacements that
                connect the surface mixed layer with the oceanic interior. Using
                a realistic, high-resolution model simulation for this region,
                we conduct the offline advection of virtual water parcels
                released near the surface during a 2-day episode of intense FG.
                Three-dimensional trajectories exhibit high variability
                depending on the release location, and some large, rapid
                vertical displacements are induced by different coherent
                submesoscale flow patterns and by interactions among them:
                Ageostrophic secondary circulation associated with strain- and
                mixing-induced FG and internal waves generated by currents over
                topography. These deep displacements mostly are irreversible, at
                least on a short time scale, because of the rapidly changing
                flow patterns. Significant diapycnal mixing and density changes
                occur along trajectories as they pass through the surface and
                bottom boundary layers. While we expect these processes to be
                typical for this region, the computational expense of such a
                Lagrangian analysis and the complexity of its outcome present a
                considerable challenge for more comprehensive assessments.

                Some lipid-biomarker-based sea surface temperature (SST) proxies
                applied in the modern Mediterranean Sea exhibit large offsets
                from expected values, generating uncertainties in climate
                reconstructions. Lateral transport of proxy carriers along ocean
                currents prior to burial can contribute to this offset between
                reconstructed and expected SSTs. We perform virtual particle
                tracking experiments to simulate transport prior to and during
                sinking and derive a quantitative estimate of transport bias for
                alkenones and glycerol dibiphytanyl glycerol tetraethers

                Mediterranean Sea and does not substantially contribute to
                uncertainties in UK'37- or TEX86-based SSTs.

                Marine particles are important regulators of the biogeochemistry
                of many trace elements and isotopes in the ocean, and as such,
                there has been an increasing motivation to unravel the processes
                which control their cycling. Here, we present vertical
                distributions of total particulate trace elements (Al, V, Fe, Mn
                and P) and particulate organic carbon and particulate nitrogen
                (POC and pN) collected during the GEOTRACES Canadian cruise in
                2015 in the Canada Basin (CB), the Canadian Arctic Archipelago
                (CAA), Baffin Bay (BB) and the Labrador Sea (LS), where
                particulate trace metal data are scarce. While particulate trace
                elements are generally affected by one–dimensional dynamics in
                ocean waters (e.g. deposition, scavenging/remineralization, and
                sinking), lateral transport of lithogenic–derived particles
                (pAl, pV and pFe) plays a dominant role in shaping their
                distributions in the deep CB, BB and LS basins. Higher
                concentrations of the aforementioned particulate trace elements
                are measured along the flow path of boundary currents and in
                near–bottom waters. Unlike pAl, pV and pFe, primarily controlled
                by lithogenic sources, bulk pMn distributions in our study
                regions (with the exception of LS) are dominated by authigenic
                Mn+3/4 oxides, with distinctively high concentrations in CB and
                BB subsurface halocline waters, as well as in the deepest
                samples in BB. Enhanced bacterially-mediated Mn+2 oxide
                formation is anticipated to occur in these halocline waters
                which have the potential to sustain large populations of Mn
                oxidizing bacteria as result of the close sediment-water
                interactions and distinct environmental conditions of these
                water masses. Overall, the highest concentrations of pP, POC and
                pN occurred in surface and near–surface waters (&gt; 100 m) at
                the same density as a chlorophyll-a peak and transmissivity
                drop, with a clear west–east increasing concentration gradient
                from the CB to LS. In summary, biogeochemical cycles of
                particulate elements in the Canadian Arctic Ocean are controlled
                by enhanced lateral transport and sediment resuspension (pAl,
                pFe and pV), authigenic formation of Mn and biological
                production (pP, POC and pN).

                Beaches are thought to be a large reservoir for marine plastics.
                To protect vulnerable beaches, it is advantageous to have
                information on the sources of this plastic. Here, we develop a
                universally applicable Bayesian framework to map sources of
                plastic arriving on a specific beach. In this framework, we
                combine Lagrangian backtracking simulations of drifting
                particles with estimates of plastic input from coastlines,
                rivers and fisheries. The advantage over traditional Lagrangian
                simulations is that the Bayesian framework can consider
                information on known sources, and thus facilitates
                spatiotemporal source attribution for plastic arriving at the
                specified beach. We show that the main sources for our target
                beach in southwest Netherlands are the east coast of the UK, the
                Dutch coast, the English Channel (fisheries) and the Thames,
                Seine, Rhine and Trieux (rivers). We also show that floating
                time is a major uncertainty in source attribution using
                backtracking.

                Having descended through the water column, microplankton in
                ocean sediments are representative for the ocean surface
                environment, where they originated from. Sedimentary
                microplankton is therefore used as an archive of past and
                present surface oceanographic conditions. However, these
                particles are advected by turbulent ocean currents during their
                sinking journey. So far, it is unknown to what extent this
                particle advection shapes the microplankton composition in
                sediments. Here we use global simulations of sinking particles
                in a strongly eddying global ocean model, and define ocean
                bottom provinces based on the particle surface origin locations.
                We find that these provinces can be detected in global datasets
                of sedimentary microplankton assemblages, demonstrating the
                effect provincialism has on the composition of sedimentary
                remains of surface plankton. These provinces explain the
                microplankton composition, in addition to e.g. ocean surface
                environment. Connected provinces have implications on the
                optimal spatial extent of microplankton sediment sample datasets
                that are used for palaeoceanographic reconstructions, and on the
                optimal spatial averaging of sediment samples over global
                datasets.

                To capture the effects of mesoscale turbulent eddies,
                coarse-resolution Eulerian ocean models resort to tracer
                diffusion parameterizations. Likewise, the effect of eddy
                dispersion needs to be parameterized when computing Lagrangian
                pathways using coarse flow fields. Dispersion in Lagrangian
                simulations is traditionally parameterized by random walks,
                equivalent to diffusion in Eulerian models. Beyond random walks,
                there is a hierarchy of stochastic parameterizations, where
                stochastic perturbations are added to Lagrangian particle
                velocities, accelerations, or hyper-accelerations. These
                parameterizations are referred to as the 1st, 2nd and 3rd order
                “Markov models” (Markov-N), respectively. Most previous studies
                investigate these parameterizations in two-dimensional setups,
                often restricted to the ocean surface. On the other hand, the
                few studies that investigated Lagrangian dispersion
                parameterizations in three dimensions, where dispersion is
                largely restricted to neutrally buoyant surfaces, have focused
                only on random walk (Markov-0) dispersion. Here, we present a
                three-dimensional isoneutral formulation of the Markov-1 model.
                We also implement an anisotropic, shear-dependent formulation of
                random walk dispersion, originally formulated as a Eulerian
                diffusion parameterization. Random walk dispersion and Markov-1
                are compared using an idealized setup as well as more realistic
                coarse and coarsened (50 km) ocean model output. While random
                walk dispersion and Markov-1 produce similar particle
                distributions over time when using our ocean model output,
                Markov-1 yields Lagrangian trajectories that better resemble
                trajectories from eddy-resolving simulations. Markov-1 also
                yields a smaller spurious dianeutral flux.

                dissolved oxygen (O2) in the upper equatorial Pacific water
                column. In CESM-HR, the simulated generation and westward
                propagation of TIVs from boreal summer through winter lead to
                the seasonal oxygenation of the upper northern equatorial
                Pacific, exhibited as a deepening of hypoxic depth west of
                120°W. TIV effects on the equatorial Pacific oxygen balance are
                dominated by eddy-advection and mixing, while indirect TIV
                effects on O2 consumption play minor roles. These advective
                effects reflect the transient displacements of isopycnals by
                eddy pumping as well as vortex transport of oxygen by eddy
                trapping, stirring, and subduction. TIVs influence on the upper

                implications for understanding and modeling marine ecosystem
                dynamics and habitats, and should be taken into consideration in

                Jakarta is the capital of Indonesia with a high population
                density, which affects the amount of waste generated. The waste
                that ends up in Jakarta Bay has become an environmental problem.
                Understanding the pathway of marine debris in the ocean is
                important to identify the mitigation strategies. Before this
                study, the pathways and sources of marine debris in Jakarta Bay
                were unknown. By using virtual floating marine debris particles
                in a high-resolution ocean model, the fate of marine debris
                based on the pathways of particles released in Jakarta Bay in
                both forward and backward tracking experiments was analyzed. It
                was found that most of the particles from Jakarta Bay flow
                toward the Indian Ocean in all seasons. They flow off through
                the Sunda Strait and reach the open Indian Ocean after a few
                weeks. With regard to the source location, most particles that
                end up in Jakarta Bay come from the north of Java Island locally
                and from the Gulf of Thailand, Sumatra, and Kalimantan coasts.
                The particles do not appear to vary significantly across all
                seasons and identifying the pathway of marine debris might be
                useful in pollution reduction.

                Identifying internal waves in complex flow fields is a
                long-standing problem in fluid dynamics, oceanography and
                atmospheric science, owing to the overlap of internal waves
                temporal and spatial scales with other flow regimes. Lagrangian
                filtering—that is, temporal filtering in a frame of reference
                moving with the flow—is one proposed methodology for performing
                this separation. Here we (a) describe an improved implementation
                of the Lagrangian filtering methodology and (b) introduce a new
                freely available, parallelized Python package that applies the
                method. We show that the package can be used to directly filter
                output from a variety of common ocean models including MITgcm,
                Regional Ocean Modeling System and MOM5 for both regional and
                global domains at high resolution. The Lagrangian filtering is
                shown to be a useful tool to both identify (and thereby
                quantify) internal waves, and to remove internal waves to
                isolate the non-wave flow field.

                The present study investigates the advective pathways and
                transit times of virtual particles released in the Red Sea
                outflow area as a proxy for the poorly understood spreading of
                the Red Sea Overflow Water (RSOW) in the Arabian Sea. This work
                uses the Parcels toolbox, a Lagrangian framework, to simulate
                tens of thousands of trajectories under different initial
                conditions. Six different Lagrangian simulations are performed
                at isobaric and isopycnal surfaces within the RSOW layer. All
                simulations are based on the eddy-rich GLORYS12 reanalysis that
                merges almost all in-situ (temperature-salinity) and satellite
                observations collected over the last two decades into a
                dynamical framework. This study shows that GLORYS12 reproduces
                relatively well the climatological seasonal cycle of the RSOW to
                the Gulf of Aden and essential characteristics of the exchange
                at the Strait of Bab al-Mandab. Statistical comparisons between
                synthetic trajectories and RAFOS floats in the Gulf of Aden
                corroborate the quality of GLORYS12 velocity fields used for the
                Lagrangian simulations. Six main advective pathways are
                uncovered (by order of preference): Southwest, Northwest,
                Socotra Passage, Central, Eastern, and Southern. Trajectories
                from Argo floats give observational support for some of these
                paths. Although most particles are exported out of the Arabian
                Sea off Somalia, the simulations reveal robust connectivity of
                the RSOW to the Arabian Sea interior and its eastern boundary.
                The fact that particles have long trajectories in the interior
                increases the potential of RSOW mixing with the fresher and
                oxygen-poor ambient waters. Thus, these pathways may have
                profound implications for the salt and oxygen budgets in the
                Arabian Sea since the RSOW is also part of the global
                overturning circulation and exported out of the Indian Ocean via
                the Agulhas Current. Transit time distributions indicate that it
                takes about six months for outflow-originated particles to
                spread over the entire Gulf of Aden and one to three years to be
                exported along the western boundary, toward Somalia (Socotra
                Passage and Southwest pathways) and off the Yemeni-Omani coast
                (Northwest Pathway). In contrast, reaching the eastern boundary
                takes much longer. North of 14 N, the most frequent time is
                around 10–15 years, and about 20–25 years at the southeastern
                Arabian Sea. Hence, the RSOW can often carry oxygen to the
                western boundary but not to the eastern basin. This may
                contribute to the eastern shift of the Arabian Sea Oxygen
                Minimum Zone, a subject that deserves investigation.

                Coastal upwellings, due to offshore Ekman transport, are more
                energetic at the western boundaries of the oceans, where they
                are intensified by incoming Rossby waves, than at the eastern
                boundaries. Western boundary upwellings are often accompanied by
                a local vortex field. The instability of a developed upwelling
                front and its interaction with an external vortex field is
                studied here with a three-dimensional numerical model of the
                hydrostatic rotating Navier-Stokes equations (the primitive
                equations). The baroclinic instability of the front leads to the
                growth of meanders with 100-200 km wavelength, in the absence of
                external vortex. On the 𝑓-plane, these waves can break into a
                row of vortices when the instability is intense. The 𝛽-effect is
                stabilizing and strongly decreases the amplitude of meanders.
                Simulations are then performed with a front initially
                accompanied by one or several external vortices. The evolutions
                in this case are compared with those of the unstable jet alone.
                On the 𝑓-plane, when an external vortex is close to the front,
                this latter sheds a long filament which wraps up around the
                vortex. This occurs over a period similar to that of the
                instability of the isolated front. Cyclones are more efficient
                in tearing such filaments offshore than anticyclones. On the
                𝛽-plane, the filaments are short and turbulence is confined to
                the vicinity of the front. At long times, waves propagate along
                the front, thus extending turbulence alongshore. The initial
                presence of a vortex alley leads to a stronger destabilization
                of the front and to a larger cross-shore flux than for a single
                vortex, with many filaments and small vortices pushed far
                offshore. In the ocean, this cross-shore exchange has important
                consequences on the local biological activity.

                The southern branch of the South Equatorial Current (SSEC) is
                the northern limit of the South Atlantic Subtropical Gyre. When
                this current reaches Brazil around 14°S it bifurcates into a
                southward flow as the Brazil Current (BC) and the surface
                portion of the northward flowing North Brazil Undercurrent
                (NBUC). The SSEC system is a key component of the western
                boundary supply, influencing the NBUC/BC variability and,
                therefore, global climate through the Meridional Overturning
                Circulation. In this study, using altimetry satellite data and
                reanalyzes outputs (1993–2018), we revisit the SSEC mean state
                and show this current arriving at the South Atlantic western
                boundary as a multi-banded flow with surface signatures
                resulting from different subsurface cores. These bands have
                velocities between 0.02 and 0.07 m s−1 and, as shown by ADCP
                data from the PIRATA project, their signature in synoptic
                scenarios is obscured by eddies and waves with velocities
                between 0.1 and 0.3 m s−1. In addition, the SSEC annual cycle
                analysis shows that the seasonality of the bands is out of phase
                with each other, presenting westward transport anomalies between
                0.4 and 2.6 Sv. Finally, our results show that the seasonality
                of this multi-banded flow both defines where the BC is born, and
                modulates the seasonality of semi-permanent mesoscale eddies off
                Brazil.

                Marine plastics are considered to be a major threat to the
                sustainable use of marine and coastal resources of the
                Caribbean, on which the region relies heavily for tourism and
                fishing. To date, little work has quantified plastics within the
                Caribbean marine environment or examined their potential
                sources. This study aimed to address this by holistically
                integrating marine (surface water, subsurface water and
                sediment) and terrestrial sampling and Lagrangian particle
                tracking to examine the potential origins, flows and quantities
                of plastics within the Southern Caribbean. Terrestrial litter
                and the microplastics identified in marine samples may arise
                from the maritime and tourism industries, both of which are
                major contributors to the economies of the Caribbean region. The
                San Blas islands, Panama had the highest abundance of
                microplastics at a depth of 25 m, and significantly greater
                quantities in surface water than recorded in the other
                countries. Modelling indicated the microplastics likely arose
                from mainland Panama, which has some of the highest levels of
                mismanaged waste. Antigua had among the lowest quantities of
                terrestrial and marine plastics, yet the greatest diversity of
                polymers. Modelling indicated the majority of the microplastics
                in Antiguan coastal surface were likely to have originated from
                the wider North Atlantic Ocean. Ocean currents influence the
                movements of plastics and thus the relative contributions
                arising from local and distant sources which become distributed
                within a country's territorial water. These transboundary
                movements can undermine local or national legislation aimed at
                reducing plastic pollution. While this study presents a snapshot
                of plastic pollution, it contributes towards the void of
                knowledge regarding marine plastic pollution in the Caribbean
                Sea and highlights the need for international and
                interdisciplinary collaborative research and solutions to
                plastic pollution.

                The Lagrangian analysis of particulate matter, biota and
                drifters, which are dispersed by turbulent fluid currents, is a
                cornerstone of oceanographic studies, covering diverse study
                objectives. The results of Lagrangian simulations and
                observations is predominantly visualised by means of easy-access
                plotting interfaces and simple presentation techniques. We
                analysed over 50 publications from the years 2010–2020 with
                respect to their visual design to deduce common visualisation
                practices in the domain. Individual figures are analysed towards
                adherence to visualisation best-practices, algebraic
                visualisation guidelines and the IPCC visual style guide. In
                this article, we present the resulting best-practices and common
                pitfalls in the design of Lagrangian ocean visualisations. Based
                on this visual study, we highlight that raising awareness of
                established visual guidelines may have a higher impact on
                improving the visual quality of publications in oceanography
                than the vigorous development of more general-purpose
                visualisation tools.

                The southward flow of North Atlantic Deep Water makes up the
                major component of the deepwater limb of the Atlantic Meridional
                Overturning Circulation (AMOC). In the subtropical North
                Atlantic, it's flow is concentrated along the continental slope,
                forming a coherent Deep Western Boundary Current (DWBC). Both,
                observations and models show a high variability of the flow in
                this region. Here we use an eddy-rich ocean model to show that
                this variability is mainly caused by eddies and meanders. Their
                formation process involves an important contribution from energy
                transfer by barotropic instability. They occur along the entire
                DWBC pathway and introduce several recirculation gyres that
                result in a decorrelation of the DWBC transport at 26.5°N and
                16°N, despite the fact that a considerable mean transport of 20
                Sv connects the two latitudes. Water in the DWBC at 26.5°N is
                partly returned northward. Because the amount of water returned
                depends on the DWBC transport itself, a stronger DWBC does not
                necessarily lead to an increased amount of water that reaches
                16°N. Along the pathway to 16°N, the transport signal is altered
                by a broad and temporally variable transit time distribution.
                Thus, advection in the DWBC cannot account for coherent AMOC
                changes on interannual timescales seen in the model.

                How far do marine larvae disperse in the ocean? Decades of
                population genetic studies have revealed generally low levels of
                genetic structure at large spatial scales (hundreds of
                kilometres). Yet this result, typically based on discrete
                sampling designs, does not necessarily imply extensive
                dispersal. Here, we adopt a continuous sampling strategy along
                950 km of coast in the northwestern Mediterranean Sea to address
                this question in four species. In line with expectations, we
                observe weak genetic structure at a large spatial scale.
                Nevertheless, our continuous sampling strategy uncovers a
                pattern of isolation by distance at small spatial scales (few
                tens of kilometres) in two species. Individual-based simulations
                indicate that this signal is an expected signature of restricted
                dispersal. At the other extreme of the connectivity spectrum,
                two pairs of individuals that are closely related genetically
                were found more than 290 km apart, indicating long-distance
                dispersal. Such a combination of restricted dispersal with rare
                long-distance dispersal events is supported by a high-resolution
                biophysical model of larval dispersal in the study area, and we
                posit that it may be common in marine species. Our results
                bridge population genetic studies with direct dispersal studies
                and have implications for the design of marine reserve networks.

                The constant increase of marine plastic pollution poses an
                unprecedented risk to oceanic islands, which become increasingly
                exposed to a hazard of which they have very little control.
                Located in the Northeast Atlantic Ocean, the Macaronesia is
                comprised by the Azores, Madeira, Canary Islands, and Cabo
                Verde. Although past studies suggest that most plastic items
                collected on these islands are from offshore regions, their
                actual sources remain unclear to present date. As such, we focus
                on the characterization of the potential sources and pathways of
                plastic particles reaching the Macaronesia archipelagos. This is
                achieved by combining modeled datasets for ocean currents, winds
                and waves with a Lagrangian tool used to track virtual particles
                released around the archipelagos for a 10-year period, making a
                distinction between surface and submerged particles. Global
                drifter trajectories are also assessed, selecting those that
                intercept the archipelagos. Our results demonstrate that the
                North Atlantic subtropical gyre is the most conspicuous feature
                in particles and drifter trajectories. The Gulf Stream acts as
                the main pathway for all archipelagos at a regional scale,
                though with less significance to Cabo Verde. Surface particles
                are connected to regional sources in a shorter timescale than
                mixed particles, mainly because of the wind. Intercepting
                high-windage particle trajectories are dominant at the center of
                the North Atlantic subtropical gyre, demonstrating that
                particles originating from the North Atlantic “garbage patch”
                are most likely to intercept the archipelagos if considerably
                exposed to the wind. Regarding the connectivity to sources, all
                archipelagos are significantly exposed to areas of intensive
                fishing activity, mainly those located in the Gulf Stream
                (Azores), in international waters off the Portuguese coast
                (Madeira and Canary Islands) and along the Northwestern African
                coast (Cabo Verde). The east coasts of Central and North America
                are the main sources of land-based particles reaching the
                Azores, Madeira, and Canary Islands, whereas the Northwestern
                African coast is the main source for land-based particles
                reaching Cabo Verde. Our results demonstrate how vulnerable the
                Macaronesian archipelagos are to marine plastic pollution,
                highlighting the urgency for international cooperation to
                mitigate the exposure of oceanic islands to marine plastic
                pollution.

                Plastic is the most abundant type of marine litter and it is
                found in all of the world’s oceans and seas, even in remote
                areas far from human activities. It is a major concern because
                plastics remain in the oceans for a long time. To address
                questions that are of great interest to the international
                community as it seeks to attend to the major sources of marine
                plastics in the ocean, we use particle tracking simulations to
                simulate the motions of mismanaged plastic waste and provide a
                quantitative global estimate of (1) where does the marine litter
                released into the ocean by a given country go and (2) where does
                the marine litter found on the coastline of a given country come

                The ability to provide rapid decision support and more precise
                search area coordinates for rescuers to conduct search and
                rescue operations at sea are of high impact value for marine and
                maritime stakeholders. Search and rescue operations rely on
                accurate information about metocean conditions to locate objects
                in the ocean. These include local knowledge, operational ocean
                and wind forecasts and empirical drift relationships between
                ocean currents, ocean surface winds and the objects being
                searched for. To provide more accurate decision support for
                rescuers looking for persons or objects lost at sea, a virtual
                particle tracking tool was combined with an empirical Leeway
                drift model. The Lagrangian Ocean Search Targets (LOST)
                application builds on a Lagrangian ocean analysis framework
                which has been adapted to provide real-time estimates of the
                positions of objects based on operational ocean and wind
                forecasts. LOST incorporates the impact of ocean currents,
                surface winds and stochastic motion, the latter being critical
                in accounting for sub-grid scale processes that are not resolved
                in the ocean and wind forecasts. This study assesses the
                accuracy of LOST, demonstrating its feasibility as a decision
                support tool for search and rescue operations by applying it to
                three use cases in the South African regional ocean. These use
                cases are real-life scenarios that highlight the value of
                combining state-of-the-art ocean and wind forecasting systems
                with Lagrangian ocean analyses frameworks and sub-grid scale
                parameterisation to support global operational oceanography.

                Microplastic debris ending up at the sea surface has become a
                known major environmental issue. However, how microplastic
                particles move and when they sink in the ocean remains largely
                unknown. Here, we model microplastic subject to biofouling
                (algal growth on a substrate) to estimate sinking timescales and
                the time to reach the depth where particles stop sinking. We
                combine NEMO‐MEDUSA 2.0 output, that represents hydrodynamic and
                biological properties of seawater, with a particle‐tracking
                framework. Different sizes and densities of particles (for
                different types of plastic) are simulated, showing that the
                global distribution of sinking timescales is largely
                size‐dependent as opposed to density‐dependent. The smallest
                particles we simulate (0.1 μm) start sinking almost immediately
                around the globe and their trajectories take the longest time to
                reach their first sinking depth (relative to larger particles).
                In oligotrophic subtropical gyres with low algal concentrations,
                particles between 1 mm and 10 μm do not sink within the 90‐day
                simulation time. This suggests that in addition to the
                comparatively well‐known physical processes, biological
                processes might also contribute to the accumulation of floating
                plastic (of 1 mm–10 μm) in subtropical gyres. Particles of 1 μm
                in the gyres start sinking largely due to vertical advection,
                whereas in the equatorial Pacific they are more dependent on
                biofouling. The qualitative impacts of seasonality on sinking
                timescales are small, however, localised sooner sinking due to
                spring algal blooms is seen. This study maps processes that
                affect the sinking of virtual microplastic globally, which could
                ultimately impact the ocean plastic budget.

                Global coastlines potentially contain significant amounts of
                plastic debris, with harmful implications for marine and coastal
                ecosystems, fisheries and tourism. However, the global amount,
                distribution and origin of plastic debris on beaches and in
                coastal waters is currently unknown. Here we analyse beaching
                and resuspension scenarios using a Lagrangian particle transport
                model. Throughout the first 5 years after entering the ocean,
                the model indicates that at least 77% of positively buoyant
                marine plastic debris (PBMPD) released from land-based sources
                is either beached or floating in coastal waters, assuming no
                further plastic removal from beaches or the ocean surface. The
                highest concentrations of beached PBMPD are found in Southeast
                Asia, caused by high plastic inputs from land and limited
                off-shore transport, although the absolute concentrations are
                generally overestimates compared to field measurements. The
                modelled distribution on a global scale is only weakly
                influenced by local variations in resuspension rates due to
                coastal geomorphology. Furthermore, there are striking
                differences regarding the origin of the beached plastic debris.
                In some Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZ), such as the Indonesian
                Archipelago, plastic originates almost entirely from within the
                EEZ while in other EEZs, particularly remote islands, almost all
                beached plastic debris arrives from remote sources. Our results
                highlight coastlines and coastal waters as important reservoirs
                of marine plastic debris and limited transport of PBMPD between
                the coastal zone and the open ocean.

                The forecast of tropical cyclone (TC) intensity is a significant
                challenge. In this study, we showcase the impact of strongly
                coupled data assimilation with hypothetical ocean currents on
                analyses and forecasts of Typhoon Hato (2017). Several
                observation simulation system experiments were undertaken with a
                regional coupled ocean-atmosphere model. We assimilated
                combinations of (or individually) a hypothetical coastal current
                HF radar network, a dense array of drifter floats and minimum
                sea-level pressure. During the assimilation, instant updates of
                many important atmospheric variables (winds and pressure) are
                achieved from the assimilation of ocean current observations
                using the cross-domain error covariance, significantly improving
                the track and intensity analysis of Typhoon Hato. As compared to
                a control experiment (with no assimilation), the error of
                minimum pressure decreased by up to 13 hPa (4 hPa / 57 % on
                average). The maximum wind speed error decreased by up to 18
                knots (5 knots / 41 % on average). By contrast, weakly coupled
                implementations cannot match these reductions (10% on average).
                Although traditional atmospheric observations were not
                assimilated, such improvements indicate there is considerable
                potential in assimilating ocean currents from coastal HF radar,
                and surface drifters within a strongly coupled framework for
                intense landfalling TCs.

                The variability of La Guajira upwelling system, in the
                south-central Caribbean Sea, is strongly influenced by the
                intensity and location of the atmospheric Caribbean Low-Level
                Jet (CLLJ), a near-surface branch of the easterlies, as well as
                by the regional ocean circulation. During favorable conditions
                (i.e., strong easterlies blowing almost parallel to the coast),
                upwelling is enhanced and a large amount of primary productivity
                occurs in La Guajira area. In contrast, during relatively mild
                wind conditions, the CLLJ is misaligned to the coast and the
                Caribbean Counter Current (CCC, locally also known as the Darien
                Current), which forms as a branch from the Panama-Colombia Gyre,
                flows northeastward over the continental shelf advecting waters
                from the southwestern Caribbean basin toward La Guajira. The CCC
                has a clear signature at the surface layer that extends from the
                Darien Gulf toward La Guajira peninsula during mild wind
                periods, while disappears during the months of strong winds. The
                direction and the magnitude of the easterlies, and more
                specifically of the CLLJ, control the position and pathway of
                the CCC, which extends more than 900 km in the southern
                Caribbean Sea during May, June, August, September, and October.
                The high concentration of chlorophyll-a at the sea surface
                evidenced by satellite-based color images is semi-seasonally
                modulated by the CLLJ, which during its relaxation phase allows
                the irruption of the CCC toward the east up to La Guajira.

                Antarctic sea ice is prevalently seen as a major player in the
                climate system, but it is also an important factor in polar
                maritime safety. Remote sensing and forecasting of Southern
                Ocean sea ice at time scales suitable for navigation and
                research planning remain challenging. In this study, numerical
                sea ice drift forecasts are assessed from the perspective of
                informing shipping operations. A series of tests is performed to
                ascertain whether an operational global ocean and sea ice model
                and a simple free-drift model can provide accurate drift
                estimates over short lead times. Both approaches are evaluated
                against ice drift measurements from buoys deployed during two
                research cruises in the Southern Ocean marginal ice zone during
                winter and spring. The numerical forecast model was able to
                forecast sea ice trajectories over 24 h with an average position
                error of 16.6 km during winter and 9.2 km during spring. The
                simpler free-drift model, using empirically optimised wind
                scaling, returned an average position error of 15.9 and 9.3 km
                during winter and spring respectively. Model skill for both the
                dynamical and free-drift models is lower in winter than in
                spring. Free-drift model skill appears linked with sea ice
                consolidation, which may assist in determining when and where
                this approach is fit for purpose. Lingering uncertainties
                regarding the rheological representation of sea ice in the
                dynamical model and the quality of the wind and ocean forcing
                remain, potentially affecting model skill over tactical
                navigation time frames.

                We study the vertical dispersion and distribution of negatively
                buoyant rigid microplastics within a realistic circulation model
                of the Mediterranean sea. We first propose an equation
                describing their idealized dynamics. In that framework, we
                evaluate the importance of some relevant physical effects:
                inertia, Coriolis force, small-scale turbulence and variable
                seawater density, and bound the relative error of simplifying
                the dynamics to a constant sinking velocity added to a
                large-scale velocity field. We then calculate the amount and
                vertical distribution of microplastic particles on the water
                column of the open ocean if their release from the sea surface
                is continuous at rates compatible with observations in the
                Mediterranean. The vertical distribution is found to be almost
                uniform with depth for the majority of our parameter range.
                Transient distributions from flash releases reveal a
                non-Gaussian character of the dispersion and various diffusion
                laws, both normal and anomalous. The origin of these behaviors
                is explored in terms of horizontal and vertical flow
                organization.

                The Tropical Atlantic Ocean has recently been the source of
                enormous amounts of floating Sargassum macroalgae that have
                started to inundate shorelines in the Caribbean, the western
                coast of Africa and northern Brazil. It is still unclear,
                however, how the surface currents carry the Sargassum, largely
                restricted to the upper meter of the ocean, and whether observed
                surface drifter trajectories and hydrodynamical ocean models can
                be used to simulate its pathways. Here, we analyse a dataset of
                two types of surface drifters (38 in total), purposely deployed
                in the Tropical Atlantic Ocean in July, 2019. Twenty of the
                surface drifters were undrogued and reached only ~8 cm into the
                water, while the other eighteen were standard Surface Velocity
                Program (SVP) drifters that all had a drogue centered around 15
                m depth. We show that the undrogued drifters separate more
                slowly than the drogued SVP drifters, likely because of the
                suppressed turbulence due to convergence in wind rows, which was
                stronger right at the surface than at 15 m depth. Undrogued
                drifters were also more likely to enter the Caribbean Sea. We
                also show that the novel Surface and Merged Ocean Currents
                (SMOC) product from the Copernicus Marine Environmental Service
                (CMEMS) does not clearly simulate one type of drifter better
                than the other, highlighting the need for further improvements
                in assimilated hydrodynamic models in the region, for a better
                understanding and forecasting of Sargassum drift in the Tropical
                Atlantic.

                To identify barriers to transport in a fluid domain, community
                detection algorithms from network science have been used to
                divide the domain into clusters that are sparsely connected with
                each other. In a previous application to the closed domain of
                the Mediterranean Sea, communities detected by the Infomap
                algorithm have barriers that often coincide with well‐known
                oceanographic features. We apply this clustering method to the
                surface of the Arctic and subarctic oceans and thereby show that
                it can also be applied to open domains. First, we construct a
                Lagrangian flow network by simulating the exchange of Lagrangian
                particles between different bins in an icosahedral‐hexagonal
                grid. Then, Infomap is applied to identify groups of
                well‐connected bins. The resolved transport barriers include
                naturally occurring structures, such as the major currents. As
                expected, clusters in the Arctic are affected by seasonal and
                annual variations in sea‐ice concentration. An important caveat
                of community detection algorithms is that many different
                divisions into clusters may qualify as good solutions. Moreover,
                while certain cluster boundaries lie consistently at the same
                location between different good solutions, other boundary
                locations vary significantly, making it difficult to assess the
                physical meaning of a single solution. We therefore consider an
                ensemble of solutions to find persistent boundaries, trends and
                correlations with surface velocities and sea‐ice cover.

                The detection of finite-time coherent particle sets in
                Lagrangian trajectory data using data clustering techniques is
                an active research field at the moment. Yet, the clustering
                methods mostly employed so far have been based on graph
                partitioning, which assigns each trajectory to a cluster, i.e.
                there is no concept of noisy, incoherent trajectories. This is
                problematic for applications to the ocean, where many small
                coherent eddies are present in a large fluid domain. In
                addition, to our knowledge none of the existing methods to
                detect finite-time coherent sets has an intrinsic notion of
                coherence hierarchy, i.e. the detection of finite-time coherent
                sets at different spatial scales. Such coherence hierarchies are
                present in the ocean, where basin scale coherence coexists with
                smaller coherent structures such as jets and mesoscale eddies.
                Here, for the first time in this context, we use the
                density-based clustering algorithm OPTICS (Ankerst et al., 1999)
                to detect finite-time coherent particle sets in Lagrangian
                trajectory data. Different from partition based clustering
                methods, OPTICS does not require to fix the number of clusters
                beforehand. Derived clustering results contain a concept of
                noise, such that not every trajectory needs to be part of a
                cluster. OPTICS also has a major advantage compared to the
                previously used DBSCAN method, as it can detect clusters of
                varying density. Further, clusters can also be detected based on
                density changes instead of absolute density. Finally, OPTICS
                based clusters have an intrinsically hierarchical structure,
                which allows to detect coherent trajectory sets at different
                spatial scales at once. We apply OPTICS directly to Lagrangian
                trajectory data in the Bickley jet model flow and successfully
                detect the expected vortices and the jet. The resulting
                clustering separates the vortices and the jet from background
                noise, with an imprint of the hierarchical clustering structure
                of coherent, small scale vortices in a coherent, large-scale,
                background flow. We then apply our method to a set of virtual
                trajectories released in the eastern South Atlantic Ocean in an
                eddying ocean model and successfully detect Agulhas rings. At
                larger scale, our method also separates the eastward and
                westward moving parts of the subtropical gyre. We illustrate the
                difference between our approach and partition based k-Means
                clustering using a 2-dimensional embedding of the trajectories
                derived from classical multidimensional scaling. We also show
                how OPTICS can be applied to the spectral embedding of a
                trajectory based network to overcome the problems of k-Means
                spectral clustering in detecting Agulhas rings.

                Novel 3-D passive particle tracking experiments were performed
                in the northwest Atlantic to elucidate connectivity among areas
                closed to protect vulnerable marine ecosystems. We examined (1)
                the degree of vertical movement of particles released at
                different depths and locations; (2) the location of potential
                source populations for the deep-sea taxa protected by the
                closures; and (3) the degree of functional connectivity. A
                long-term oceanographic dataset (EN4) was queried to
                characterize the temperature and salinity regimes in each of the
                closed areas as a basis for interpreting recently published
                climate change projections. Using the Parcels Lagrangian
                particle tracking framework and the BNAM hydrodynamic model, we
                found enhanced connectivity over previously developed 2-D models
                and unexpected, current-driven, strong (to a maximum of about
                1340 m) downward displacement at depth (450, 1000 and 2250 m),
                with weaker upward displacement except for the release depth of
                2250 m which showed upward movement of 955 m with a drift
                duration of 3 months. The current velocities create down-stream
                interdependence among closed areas and allow redundancy to
                develop in some of the areas of the network, with some of the
                larger areas also showing retention. Source populations for
                sponges in the upstream closure are likely in adjacent waters of
                the Canadian continental shelf. Collectively this information
                can be used to inform management decisions related to the size
                and placement of these closed areas, and vertical velocity
                surfaces have potential for use in species distribution modeling
                of benthic species and habitats.

                Understanding mechanisms of tropical Pacific decadal variability
                (TPDV) is of high importance for differentiating between natural
                climate variability and human induced climate change as this
                region sustains strong global teleconnections. Here, we use an
                ocean general circulation model along with a Lagrangian tracer
                simulator to investigate the advection of density compensated
                temperature anomalies (“spiciness mechanism”) as a potential
                contributor to TPDV during the 1980–2016 period. Consistent with
                observations, we find the primary regions of spiciness
                generation in the eastern subtropics of each hemisphere. Our
                results indicate that 75% of the equatorial subsurface water
                originates in the subtropics, of which two thirds come from the
                Southern hemisphere. We further show two prominent cases where
                remotely generated spiciness anomalies are advected to the
                equatorial Pacific, impacting subsurface temperature. The
                relative contribution of Northern versus Southern Hemisphere
                prominence and/or interior versus western boundary pathways
                depends on the specific event. The anomalously warm case largely
                results from advection via the Southern hemisphere interior
                (65%), while the anomalously cold case largely results from
                advection via the Northern hemisphere western boundary (48%).
                The relatively slow travel times from the subtropics to the
                equator (&gt; 4 years) suggests that these spiciness anomalies
                underpin a potentially predictable contribution to TPDV.
                However, not all decadal peaks in equatorial spiciness can be
                explained by remotely generated spiciness anomalies. In those
                cases, we propose that spiciness anomalies are generated in the
                equatorial zone through changes in the proportion of
                Northern/Southern hemisphere source waters due to their
                different mean spiciness distribution.

                Connectivity is a fundamental process driving the persistence of
                marine populations and their adaptation potential in response to
                environmental change. In this study, we analysed the population
                genetics of two morphologically highly similar deep-sea sponge
                clades (Phakellia hirondellei and the ‘Topsentia-and-Petromica’
                clade, (hereafter referred to as ‘TaP clade’)) at three
                locations in the Cantabrian Sea and simultaneously assessed the
                corresponding host microbiome by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. A
                virtual particle tracking approach (Lagrangian modelling) was
                applied to assess oceanographic connectivity in the study area.
                We observed overall genetic uniformity for both sponge clades.
                Notably, subtle genetic differences were observed for sponges of
                the TaP clade and also their microbiomes between a canyon and
                bank location, &lt; 100 km apart and with the same depth range.
                The Lagrangian model output suggests a strong retention of
                larvae in the study area with variable inter-annual connectivity
                via currents between the three sampling regions. We conclude
                that geologic features (canyons) and the prevailing ocean
                currents may dictate sponge holobiont connectivity and that
                differentiation can emerge even on small spatial scales.

                Search and find mission in ocean environment is a none trivial
                operation given the amount of random parameters associated with
                it. The uncertain and dynamic aspects related to ocean current
                movement make the trajectory prediction of drifting lost object
                onto sea water a very complicated task. In this work we present
                a novel lost target searching algorithm based on Recursive Area
                Clustering and target trajectory predication in ocean
                environment. Based on the widely known GlobCurrent v2 dataset
                which model the drifting of ocean surface current using
                satellite sensory data combined with mathematical and simulation
                modelling, we propose a regression algorithm based on our
                Recursive Area Clustering algorithm that we have developed
                previously to determine the strategic zones (weight centers)
                characterizing the high density areas extracted from drifting
                target history. Given those weight centers, we predict the
                object trajectory through refined regression. The predicted lost
                object trajectory is used to plan the path of UAV search
                mission. The model developed has a significant impact as we have
                tested our strategy in a scenario for searching an area covering
                68517 km, we have shown that 78% of the time, the lost object
                can be found within 32 km distance of the predicted trajectories
                limiting the significant search area to be about 5% of the whole
                searched area.

                A valuable analogue for assessing Earth’s sensitivity to warming
                is the Last Interglacial (LIG; 129- 116 kyr), when global
                temperatures (0 to +2CC) and mean sea level (+6 to 11 m) were
                higher than today. The direct contribution of warmer conditions
                to global sea level (thermosteric) are uncertain. We report here
                a global network of LIG sea surface temperatures (SST) obtained
                from various published temperature proxies (e.g. faunal/floral
                assemblages, Mg/Ca ratios of calcareous plankton, alkenone
                UK’37). We summarise the current limitations of SST
                reconstructions for the LIG and the spatial temperature features
                of a naturally warmer world. Because of local δ18O seawater
                changes, uncertainty in the age models of marine cores, and
                differences in sampling resolution and/or sedimentation rates,
                the reconstructions are restricted to mean conditions. To avoid
                bias towards individual LIG SSTs based on only a single (and
                potentially erroneous) measurement or a single interpolated data
                point, here we report average values across the entire LIG. Each
                site reconstruction is given as an anomaly relative to
                1981-2010, corrected for ocean drift and where available,
                seasonal estimates provided (189 annual, 99 December-February,
                and 92 June-August records). To investigate the sensitivity of
                the reconstruction to high temperatures, we also report maximum
                values during the first five millennia of the LIG (129-124 kyr).
                We find mean global annual SST anomalies of 0.2 ± 0.1C averaged
                across the LIG and an early maximum peak of 0.9 ± 0.1C
                respectively. The global dataset provides a remarkably coherent
                pattern of higher SST increases at polar latitudes than in the
                tropics (demonstrating the polar amplification of surface
                temperatures during the LIG), with comparable estimates between
                different proxies. Polewards of 45 ̊ latitude, we observe annual
                SST anomalies averaged across the full LIG of &gt;0.8 ± 0.3C in
                both hemispheres with an early maximum peak of &gt;2.1 ± 0.3C.
                Using the reconstructed SSTs suggests a mean LIG global
                thermosteric sea level rise of 0.08 ± 0.1 m and a peak
                contribution of 0.39 ± 0.1 m respectively (assuming warming
                penetrated to 2000 m depth). The data provide an important
                natural baseline for a warmer world, constraining the
                contributions of Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets to global
                sea level during a geographically widespread expression of high
                sea level, and can be used to test the next inter-comparison of
                models for projecting future climate change. The dataset
                described in this paper, including summary temperature and
                thermosteric sea-level reconstructions, are available at

                The Mediterranean Sea is characterized by a relatively strong
                west to east salinity gradient, which makes it an area suitable
                to test the effect of salinity on foraminiferal shell
                geochemistry. We collected living specimens of the planktonic
                foraminifer Globigerinoides ruber (white) to analyse the
                relation between element/Ca ratios, stable oxygen isotopes of
                their shells and surface seawater salinity, isotopic composition
                and temperature. The oxygen isotopes of sea surface water
                correlate with salinity in the Mediterranean also during winter,
                when sampled for this study. Sea water oxygen and hydrogen
                isotopes are positively correlated in both the eastern and
                western Mediterranean Sea, though especially in the eastern part
                the relationship differs from values reported previously for
                that area. The slope between salinity and seawater oxygen
                isotopes is lower than previously published. Still, despite the
                rather modest slope, seawater and foraminiferal carbonate oxygen
                isotopes are correlated in our dataset although with large
                residuals and high residual variability. This scatter can be due
                to either biological variability in vital effects or
                environmental variability. Numerical models backtracking
                particles show ocean current driven mixing of particles of
                different origin might dampen sensitivity and could result in an
                offset caused by horizontal transport. Results show that Na/Ca
                is positively correlated to salinity and independent of
                temperature. Foraminiferal Mg/Ca increases with temperature, as
                expected, and in line with earlier calibrations, also in the
                high salinity environment. By using living foraminifera during
                winter, the previously established Mg/Ca-temperature calibration
                is extended to temperatures below 18 °C, which is a fundamental
                prerequisite of using single foraminifera for reconstructing
                past seasonality.

                The basinwide surface transport of tracers such as heat,
                nutrients and plastic in the North Atlantic Ocean is organized
                into large scale flow structures such as the Western Boundary
                Current and the Subtropical and Subpolar Gyres. Being able to
                identify these features from drifter data is important for
                studying tracer dispersal, but also to detect changes in the
                large scale surface flow due to climate change. We propose a new
                and conceptually simple method to detect groups of trajectories
                with similar dynamical behaviour from drifter data using network
                theory and normalized cut spectral clustering. Our network is
                constructed from conditional bin-drifter probability
                distributions and naturally handles drifter trajectories with
                data gaps and different lifetimes. The eigenvalue problem of the
                respective Laplacian can be replaced by a singular value
                decomposition of a related sparse data matrix. The construction
                of this matrix scales with O(NM + Nτ), where N is the number of
                particles, M the number of bins and τ the number of time steps.
                The concept behind our network construction is rooted in a
                particle's symbolic itinerary derived from its trajectory and a
                state space partition, which we incorporate in its most basic
                form by replacing a particle's itinerary by a probability
                distribution over symbols. We represent these distributions as
                the links of a bipartite graph, connecting particles and
                symbols. We apply our method to the periodically driven
                double-gyre flow and successfully identify well-known features.
                Exploiting the duality between particles and symbols defined by
                the bipartite graph, we demonstrate how a direct low-dimensional
                coarse definition of the clustering problem can still lead to
                relatively accurate results for the most dominant structures,
                and resolve features down to scales much below the coarse
                graining scale. Our method also performs well in detecting
                structures with incomplete trajectory data, which we demonstrate
                for the double-gyre flow by randomly removing data points. We
                finally apply our method to a set of ocean drifter trajectories
                and present the first network-based clustering of the North
                Atlantic surface transport based on surface drifters,
                successfully detecting well-known regions such as the Subpolar
                and Subtropical Gyres, the Western Boundary Current region and
                the Carribean Sea.

                A large percentage of global ocean plastic waste enters the
                northern hemisphere Indian Ocean (NIO). Despite this, it is
                unclear what happens to buoyant plastics in the NIO. Because the
                subtropics in the NIO is blocked by landmass, there is no
                subtropical gyre and no associated subtropical garbage patch in
                this region. We therefore hypothesise that plastics "beach" and
                end up on coastlines along the Indian Ocean rim. In this paper,
                we determine the influence of beaching plastics by applying
                different beaching conditions to Lagrangian particle tracking
                simulation results. Our results show that a large amount of
                plastic likely ends up on coastlines in the NIO, while some
                crosses the equator into the southern hemisphere Indian Ocean
                (SIO). In the NIO, the transport of plastics is dominated by
                seasonally reversing monsoonal currents, which transport
                plastics back and forth between the Arabian Sea and the Bay of
                Bengal. All buoyant plastic material in this region beaches
                within a few years in our simulations. Countries bordering the
                Bay of Bengal are particularly heavily affected by plastics
                beaching on coastlines. This is a result of both the large
                sources of plastic waste in the region, as well as ocean
                dynamics which concentrate plastics in the Bay of Bengal. During
                the intermonsoon period following the southwest monsoon season
                (September, October, November), plastics can cross the equator
                on the eastern side of the NIO basin into the SIO. Plastics that
                escape from the NIO into the SIO beach on eastern African
                coastlines and islands in the SIO or enter the subtropical SIO
                garbage patch.

                Estimates of plastic inputs into the ocean are orders of
                magnitude larger than what is found in the surface waters. This
                can be due to discrepancies in the sources of plastic released
                into the ocean, but can also be explained due to the fact that
                it is not well known what the most dominant sinks of marine
                plastics are, and on what time scales these operate. To get a
                better understanding on possible sources and sinks, an inverse
                modelling methodology is presented here for a Lagrangian ocean
                model, estimating floating plastic quantities in the
                Mediterranean Sea. Field measurements of plastic concentrations
                in the Mediterranean are used to inform parametrizations
                defining various sources of marine plastics, and removal of
                plastic particles due to beaching and sinking. The parameters of
                the model are found using inverse modelling, by comparison of
                model results and measurements of floating plastic
                concentrations. Time scales for the sinks are found, and likely
                sources of plastics can be ranked in importance. A new mass
                balance is made for floating plastics in the Mediterranean: for
                2015 there is an estimated input of 2,100-3,400 tonnes, and of
                plastics released since 2006, about 170-420 tonnes remain afloat
                in the surface waters, 49-63% ended up on coastlines, and 37-51%
                have sunk down.

                  Any type of non-buoyant material in the ocean is transported
                  horizontally by currents during its sinking journey. This
                  lateral transport can be far from negligible for small sinking
                  velocities. To estimate its magnitude and direction, the
                  material is often modelled as a set of Lagrangian particles
                  advected by current velocities that are obtained from Ocean
                  General Circulation Models (OGCMs). State-of-the-art OGCMs are
                  strongly eddying, similar to the real ocean, providing results
                  with a spatial resolution on the order of 10 km on a daily
                  frequency. While the importance of eddies in OGCMs is
                  well-appreciated in the physical oceanographic community,
                  other marine research communities may not. Further, many long
                  term climate modelling simulations (e.g. in paleoclimate) rely
                  on lower spatial resolution models that do not capture
                  mesoscale features. To demonstrate how much the absence of
                  mesoscale features in low-resolution models influences the
                  Lagrangian particle transport, we simulate the transport of
                  sinking Lagrangian particles using low- and high-resolution
                  global OGCMs, and assess the lateral transport differences
                  resulting from the difference in spatial and temporal model
                  resolution. We find major differences between the transport in
                  the non-eddying OGCM and in the eddying OGCM. Addition of
                  stochastic noise to the particle trajectories in the
                  non-eddying OGCM parameterises the effect of eddies well in
                  some cases (e.g. in the North Pacific gyre). The effect of a
                  coarser temporal resolution (once every 5 days versus monthly)
                  is smaller compared to a coarser spatial resolution (0.1°
                  versus 1° horizontally). We recommend to use sinking
                  Lagrangian particles, representing e.g. marine snow,
                  microplankton or sinking plastic, only with velocity fields
                  from eddying Eulerian OGCMs, requiring high-resolution models
                  in e.g. paleoceanographic studies. To increase the
                  accessibility of our particle trace simulations, we launch
                  planktondrift.science.uu.nl, an online tool to reconstruct the
                  surface origin of sedimentary particles in a specific
                  location.

                Aim: Population connectivity of benthic marine organisms depends
                strongly on planktonic larval dispersal and is controlled by
                geographic distance and oceanographic structure. We examine
                isolation by distance versus resistance to barriers (ocean
                current boundaries) against a background of post‐glacial habitat
                expansion in a small benthic fish of the Adriatic Sea.
                <p></p>
                Location: Adriatic Sea, Eastern Mediterranean.
                <p></p>
                Taxon: Tripterygion tripteronotum.
                <p></p>
                Methods: We performed population genetic analyses using
                mitochondrial control region sequences of 550 individuals from
                25 locations sampled along the Eastern Adriatic coast.
                Investigations of population structure included differentiation
                tests, cluster analyses and distance‐based redundancy analysis.
                We then ran Lagrangian simulations of passive larval drift to
                examine correlations among population structure, geographic
                distance and the Adriatic gyre system. To test for signatures of
                a post‐glacial range expansion, we modelled the demographic
                history of the populations and examined the geographic
                distribution of genetic diversity.
                <p></p>
                Results: Genetic population structure corresponded to the
                Adriatic gyres without additional effect of geographic distance.
                Inference of northward‐biased gene flow between the northern and
                the Istrian gyre was consistent with simulated trajectories of
                passive drift, whereas the phylogeographic break coinciding with
                the boundary between the Central and the Northern Adriatic gyre
                was stronger than predicted by drift simulations. Genetic
                connectivity of populations within gyres was high. Genetic
                signatures of population expansion were consistent with a rapid
                post‐glacial recolonization of the northern Adriatic.
                <p></p>
                Main conclusions: The combination of dense sampling and passive
                drift simulation allowed us to distinguish among effects of
                geographic distance, oceanographic features and
                palaeoenvironmental changes on current population structure.
                Comparisons between realized and potential connectivity
                illustrate the value of integrating different data sources to
                understand population structure and inform conservation
                planning.

                Submesoscale coherent vortices (SCVs) are numerous in
                high‐resolution numerical simulations, but their observations
                are scarce. Among the few in situ available measurements of
                SCVs, a vast majority concern anticyclones. No cyclonic SCV with
                large dynamical Rossby number (|ζ /f | &gt; 1) has ever been
                sampled. This suggested that such small cyclones may lack
                robustness. Here, we present in situ measurements of an intense
                cyclonic SCV in the Arabian Sea. This eddy lay at 600 m depth,
                with a Rossby number and a dynamical Rossby number |ζ /f | &gt;
                1.5. This cyclone was most likely generated at the mouth of the
                Gulf of Aden. It trapped and advected Red Sea Water, from there
                on. This highlights the role of deep SCVs in the spreading of
                salty waters across the Arabian Sea.

                Here we present an assessment of eddy activity in a 3,500 ×
                2,000 km region of the North Pacific. Eddies were identified and
                tracked within a numerical simulation that used the
                Massachusetts Institute of Technology general circulation model
                and an eddy characterization algorithm. Spatially, eddy births
                were more frequent: (1) nearshore (cyclones) and offshore
                (anticyclones) on the windward side of the main Hawai‘ian
                Islands; (2) in patches of cyclones and anticyclones that
                resembled the dipole structure of wind stress curl along the
                islands’ leeward side; and (3) in zonal patches of eddies of
                both polarities west and north of the islands. Temporally, high
                eddy activities occurred in spring. There was a meridional
                distribution of eddy lifespans, which increased northward.
                Cyclones were more abundant, longer‐lived, smaller, and more
                nonlinear. Reef fish spawning locations in Hawai‘i coincide with
                the regions of high eddy activity, with nonlinear eddies
                responsible for high larval retention.

                The knowledge gap on the early life-history of sea turtles
                during the “lost years” continues to hinder research and
                conservation of this critical life stage when mortality rates
                are the highest. An oceanic model was used in combination with a
                Lagrangian particle tracking framework to simulate and identify
                potential post-hatchling dispersal trajectories of loggerhead
                and leatherback turtles in the South Western Indian Ocean. The
                study aimed to investigate the effect of hatchling swimming
                behaviour on hatchling dispersal and survival probability. To
                our knowledge, this study provides the first estimate of neonate
                sea turtle dispersal in the SWIO, by combining a particle
                tracking model with in situ hatchling behavioural data. The
                model revealed that most virtual hatchlings are transported
                south-westward in the Agulhas Current with three distinct final
                locations after a year-long si- mulation (each zone comprising
                on average &gt; 20% of the total amount of particles): the
                Agulhas Return, the SE Atlantic and the Southern Ocean zones.
                However, because loggerhead hatchlings are less strong swimmers
                compared to leatherbacks, they can be advected northward in the
                near-shore coastal current. Simulations re- vealed that initial
                active swimming (frenzy) as well as variability in oceanic
                conditions strongly influenced dispersal of virtual hatchlings.
                Furthermore, variability in oceanic conditions dispersed virtual
                hatchlings into different areas where threats, like fisheries
                bycatch, might also influence their survival. Lastly, the
                results of this study have potentially broad implications for
                climate change if turtles adapt by nesting earlier/later during
                the nesting season or further south which may influence
                hatchling locomotor performance and ultimately survival at early
                life stages.

                Predicting the trajectories of buoyant objects drifting at the
                ocean surface is important for a variety of different
                applications. To minimize errors in predicted trajectories, the
                dominant transport mechanisms have to be considered. In addition
                to the background surface currents (i.e., geostrophic, tidal,
                baroclinic currents), the wind-driven drift current can have a
                significant influence on the dynamics of buoyant objects. The
                drift current consists of two components: Stokes drift and a
                wind-induced shear current. The drift current has a strong
                vertical profile that can have a large influence on the
                transport of buoyant objects. However, few practical methods
                exist that consider the vertical profile of the drift current
                when predicting particle pathways on the ocean surface. The aim
                of this paper is to introduce a depth-dependent drift current
                correction factor (“drift factor”). We test the usefulness of
                this drift factor by simulating the transport of two types of
                ocean surface drifters, released simultaneously within the
                coverage of a high-frequency ocean radar (HFR) system. Our
                results show velocity differences between the two types of
                drifters and the HFR measured ocean surface currents. We suggest
                that these differences are the result of the drift current
                vertical profile. Our particle tracking simulations provide an
                illustrative example, indicating the importance of accounting
                for a drift factor that takes the variation of the drift current
                with depth into account.

                A new estimate of Agulhas leakage transport is calculated using
                profiling floats and drifters. Since Richardson's seminal
                estimate of 15 Sv in 2007, the number of floats and drifters
                passing through the Agulhas Current has quadrupled. Within
                uncertainties we find the same leakage percentages as
                Richardson, with 34% of drifters leaking at the surface and 21%
                of floats leaking at 1,000 m depth. We find that the drifters
                tend to follow a northward leakage pathway via the Benguela
                Current compared to the northwestward leakage pathway of the
                floats along the Agulhas Ring corridor. We simulate the isobaric
                and profiling behavior of the floats and drifters using two high
                resolution models and two offline Lagrangian tracking tools,
                quantifying for the first time the sampling biases associated
                with the observations. We find that the isobaric bias cannot be
                robustly simulated but likely causes an underestimate of
                observed leakage by one or two Sverdrups. The profiling behavior
                of the floats causes no significant bias in the leakage. Fitting
                a simulated vertical leakage profile to the observed leakage
                percentages from the floats and drifters and using the mean
                Agulhas transport observed by a moored array at 34°S we find an
                improved Agulhas leakage transport of 21.3 Sv, with an estimated
                error of 4.7 Sv. Our new leakage transport is higher primarily
                because we account for leakage at depths down to 2,000 m, while
                Richardson considered only the top 1,000 m of the water column.

                Transport of larvae by ocean currents is an important dispersal
                mechanism for many species. The timing and location of spawning
                can have a large influence on settlement location. Shifts in the
                known spawning habitat of fish, whether due to climate or the
                discovery of new spawning stock, can influence the distribution
                of juveniles and our understanding of connectivity. The
                globally‐distributed species; Pomatomus saltatrix, is one such
                example where a previously unrecognised summer spawning event
                and a more southern latitudinal extent was recently reported for
                the southwest Pacific population. Although restrictions are in
                place to protect the traditional spawning event, the importance
                of the newly recognised summer spawning event is uncertain. Here
                we investigate larval dispersal of P. saltatrix using particle
                tracking simulations to identify the contributions of the
                different spawning events to settlement. By modelling dispersal
                of larvae released in northern and mid‐latitude regions over the
                Austral spring and summer we show that the newly recognised
                mid‐latitude summer spawning event contributes over 50% of the
                larvae reaching southern latitudes. This is due to a reduced
                (1‐2 d) pelagic larval duration (associated with temperature),
                resulting in reduced larval mortality, and the seasonal (summer)
                strengthening of the East Australian Current (EAC) transporting
                particles ~50km further south. These findings demonstrate that
                in dynamic boundary current systems such as the EAC, the final
                settlement location of larvae that are transported by ocean
                currents can vary considerably depending on the timing and
                location of spawning and that multiple spawning events are
                important for maximum dispersal.

                Robust predictions of future changes in global biogeochemical
                cycling require an understanding of how microorganisms adapt to
                stressful and changing environments. In the ocean, rates of
                adaptation will be a function of both evolutionary timescales
                and physical dynamics. However, little is known about this
                interaction. We examined evolutionary dynamics of marine
                microbes by combining a model of microbial adaptation with
                varying selection pressures with a high-resolution ocean
                circulation model. A trade-off emerged between two evolutionary
                strategies: (i) ability to adapt plastically to short-term
                environmental fluctuations with delayed genetic adaptation and
                (ii) more rapid genetic adaptation with limited response to
                short-term environmental fluctuations. This trade-off determines
                evolutionary timescales and provides a foundation for
                understanding distributions of microbial traits and
                biogeochemistry.

                On 7 August 2019, a 195 km2 raft of andesitic pumice was
                produced at 200 m below sea level at an unnamed submarine
                volcano in the Tonga Islands (Southwest Pacific Ocean). Drifting
                chiefly westwards, the raft reached the Fiji Islands on the 19
                September. Yachts that crossed the raft as early as two days
                post‐eruption provided an outstanding dataset of raft
                characteristics and pristine samples. Further, exceptional
                tracking of raft dispersal by satellite images allow us to
                contrast virtual particle tracking methods with ocean model
                currents to explore the relative influence of surface currents,
                wind, and wave action on pumice flotsam dispersal over up to two
                years. Attenuation of ocean waves by large and compact pumice
                rafts appears to reduce the effect of Stokes drift. The coupling
                of real‐time satellite observations with oceanographic
                Lagrangian simulations allows near‐real time forecasting for
                global maritime hazard mitigation.

                The north Atlantic subpolar gyre (SPG) has been widely
                implicated as the source of large-scale changes in the subpolar
                marine environment. However, inconsistencies between indices of
                SPG-strength have raised questions about the active role
                SPG-strength and size play in determining water properties in
                the eastern subpolar North Atlantic (ENA). Here, by analyzing
                various SPG indices derived from observations and a global
                coupled model, we show that the choice of the SPG index dictates
                the interpretation of SPG strength-salinity relationship in the
                ENA. Variability in geostrophic currents derived from observed
                hydrography and model based Lagrangian trajectories reveal zonal
                shifts of advective pathways in the ENA and meridional shifts in
                the western intergyre region. Such shifts in advective pathways
                are manifestations of variability in the size and strength of
                the SPG, and they impact salinity by modulating the proportion
                of subpolar and subtropical waters reaching the ENA. SPG indices
                based on subsurface density and principal component analysis of
                sea surface height variability capture these shifts in advective
                pathways, and are therefore best suited to describe SPG-salinity
                relationship in the ENA. Our results establish the dynamical
                constraints on the choice of the SPG index and emphasize that
                SPG indices should be cautiously interpreted.

                To better predict how populations and communities respond to
                climatic temperature variation, it is necessary to understand
                how the shape of the response of fitness-related traits to
                temperature evolves (the thermal performance curve). Currently,
                there is disagreement about the extent to which the evolution of
                thermal performance curves is constrained. One school of thought
                has argued for the prevalence of thermodynamic constraints
                through enzyme kinetics, whereas another argues that adaptation
                can—at least partly—overcome such constraints. To shed further
                light on this debate, we perform a phylogenetic meta-analysis of
                the thermal performance curve of growth rate of phytoplankton—a
                globally important functional group—, controlling for potential
                environmental effects. We find that thermodynamic constraints
                have a minor influence on the shape of the curve. In particular,
                we detect a very weak increase of the maximum curve height with
                the temperature at which the curve peaks, suggesting a weak
                “hotter-is-better” constraint. Also, instead of a constant
                thermal sensitivity of growth across species, as might be
                expected from strong constraints, we detect phylogenetic signal
                in this as well as all curve parameters. Our results suggest
                that phytoplankton thermal performance curves adapt to thermal
                environments largely in the absence of hard thermodynamic
                constraints.

                Floating plastic debris is an increasing source of pollution in
                the world's oceans. Numerical simulations using models of ocean
                currents give insight into the transport and distribution of
                microplastics in the oceans, but most simulations do not account
                for the oscillating flow caused by global barotropic tides.
                Here, we investigate the influence of barotropic tidal currents
                on the transport and accumulation of floating microplastics, by
                numerically simulating the advection of virtual plastic
                particles released all over the world's oceans and tracking
                these for 13 years. We use geostrophic and surface Ekman
                currents from GlobCurrent and the currents caused by the four
                main tidal constituents (M2, S2, K1, and O1) from the FES model.
                We analyze the differences between the simulations with and
                without the barotropic tidal currents included, focusing on the
                open ocean. In each of the simulations, we see that microplastic
                accumulates in regions in the subtropical gyres, which is in
                agreement with observations. The formation and location of these
                accumulation regions remain unaffected by the barotropic tidal
                currents. However, there are a number of coastal regions where
                we see differences when the barotropic tidal currents are
                included. Due to uncertainties of the model in coastal regions,
                further investigation is required in order to draw conclusions
                in these areas. Our results suggest that, in the global open
                ocean, barotropic tidal currents have little impact on the
                transport and accumulation of floating microplastic and can thus
                be neglected in simulations aimed at studying microplastic
                transport in the open ocean.

                We illustrate relationships between classical kernel-based
                dimensionality reduction techniques and eigendecompositions of
                empirical estimates of reproducing kernel Hilbert space
                operators associated with dynamical systems. In particular, we
                show that kernel canonical correlation analysis (CCA) can be
                interpreted in terms of kernel transfer operators and that it
                can be obtained by optimizing the variational approach for
                Markov processes score. As a result, we show that coherent sets
                of particle trajectories can be computed by kernel CCA. We
                demonstrate the efficiency of this approach with several
                examples, namely, the well-known Bickley jet, ocean drifter
                data, and a molecular dynamics problem with a time-dependent
                potential. Finally, we propose a straightforward generalization
                of dynamic mode decomposition called coherent mode
                decomposition. Our results provide a generic machine learning
                approach to the computation of coherent sets with an objective
                score that can be used for cross-validation and the comparison
                of different methods. While coherent sets of particles are
                common in dynamical systems, they are notoriously challenging to
                identify. In this article, we leverage the combination of a
                suite of methods designed to approximate the eigenfunctions of
                transfer operators with kernel embeddings in order to design an
                algorithm for detecting coherent structures in Langrangian data.
                It turns out that the resulting method is a well-known technique
                to analyze relationships between multidimensional variables,
                namely, kernel canonical correlation analysis (CCA). Our
                algorithm successfully identifies coherent structures in several
                diverse examples, including oceanic currents and a molecular
                dynamics problem with a moving potential. Furthermore, we show
                that a natural extension of our algorithm leads to a coherent
                mode decomposition (CMD), a counterpart to dynamic mode
                decomposition (DMD).

                The tracking of virtual particles is one of the main numerical
                tools to understand the global dispersion of marine plastic
                debris and has been successful in explaining the global-scale
                accumulation patterns of surface microplastic, often called
                `garbage patches'. Yet, the inherent inaccuracies in plastic
                input scenarios and ocean circulation model results produce
                uncertainties in particle trajectories, which amplify due to the
                chaotic property of the surface ocean flow. Within this chaotic
                system, the subtropical `garbage patches' correspond to the
                attractor. These facts make the large scale surface ocean
                circulation a mixing dynamical system, which means that the
                information of a particle's initial location is lost over time.
                We use mixing entropy and Markov chain mixing of the transfer
                operator associated with surface ocean transport to quantify the
                time scales of mixing for the global surface ocean in each
                subtropical basin. In the largest parts of all basins we find
                mixing times in the order of or below 10 years, which is lower
                than typical simulation times for surface plastic transport
                simulations. Maximum mixing times of more than 10 years are
                found in some parts of the North and South Pacific. Our results
                have important implications for global dispersion modelling of
                floating materials on the basin scale: precise initial
                information has little relevance for long term simulations, and

                The Galápagos Archipelago and Galápagos Marine Reserve lie
                1000 km off the coast of Ecuador and are among the world's most
                iconic wildlife refuges. However, plastic litter is now found
                even in this remote island archipelago. Prior to this study, the
                sources of this plastic litter on Galápagos coastlines were
                unidentified. Local sources are widely expected to be small,
                given the limited population and environmentally conscious
                tourism industry. Here, we show that remote sources of plastic
                pollution are also fairly localised and limited to nearby
                fishing regions and South American and Central American
                coastlines, in particular northern Peru and southern Ecuador.
                Using virtual floating plastic particles transported in
                high-resolution ocean surface currents, we analysed the plastic
                origin and fate using pathways and connectivity between the
                Galápagos region and the coastlines as well as known fishery
                locations around the east Pacific Ocean. We also analysed how
                incorporation of wave-driven currents (Stokes drift) affects
                these pathways and connectivity. We found that only virtual
                particles that enter the ocean from Peru, Ecuador, and (when
                waves are not taken into account) Colombia can reach the
                Galápagos region. It takes these particles a few months to
                travel from their coastal sources on the American continent to
                the Galápagos region. The connectivity does not seem to vary
                substantially between El Niño and La Niña years. Identifying
                these sources and the timing and patterns of the transport can
                be useful for identifying integrated management opportunities to
                reduce plastic pollution from reaching the Galápagos
                Archipelago.

                Buoyant microplastic in the ocean can be submerged to deeper
                layers through biofouling and the consequent loss of buoyancy or
                by wind induced turbulent mixing at the ocean surface. Yet the
                fact that particles in deeper layers are transported by currents
                that are different from those at the surface has not been
                explored so far. We compute 10‐year trajectories of 1 million
                virtual particles with the Parcels framework for different
                particle advection scenarios to investigate the effect of
                near‐surface currents on global particle dispersal. We simulate
                the global‐scale transport of passive microplastic for (i)
                particles constrained to different depths from the surface to
                120 m depth, (ii) particles that are randomly displaced in the
                vertical with uniform distribution, (iii) particles subject to
                surface mixing and (iv) for a 3D passive advection model. Our
                results show that the so called 'garbage patches' become more
                'leaky' in deeper layers, and completely disappear at about 60 m
                depth. At the same time, subsurface currents can transport
                significant amounts of microplastic from subtropical and
                subpolar regions to polar regions, providing a possible
                mechanism to explain why plastic is found in these remote areas.
                Finally, we show that the final distribution in the surface
                turbulent mixing scenario with particle rise speed wr=0.003 m/s
                is very similar to the distribution of plastic at the surface.
                This demonstrates that it is not necessary to incorporate
                surface mixing for global long‐term simulations, although this
                might change on more local scales and for particles with lower
                rise speeds.

                In an effort to increase purse seine fishing efficiency for
                tropical tunas, over 30,000 drifting Fish Aggregating Devices
                (dFADs) are deployed every year by fishers in the Western and
                Central Pacific Ocean (WCPO). The use of dFADs also impacts
                ecosystems, in particular through marine pollution and dFAD
                beaching. This paper presents the first estimate of dFAD
                beaching events in the WCPO (&gt;1300 in 2016–2017) and their
                distribution. Lagrangian simulations of virtual dFADs, released
                subject to contrasting deployment distributions, help us
                determine the relative importance of operational versus
                environmental drivers of dFADs drifting to beaching areas. The
                highest levels of beaching, occurring on Papua New Guinea and
                Solomon Islands, are likely a result of the prevailing westward
                oceanic circulation and subsequent local processes driving dFADs
                towards land. Similarly, high beaching rates in Tuvalu appear to
                be due to the general circulation of the WCPO. In contrast,
                beaching in Kiribati Gilbert Islands appear to be more strongly
                related to dFAD deployment strategy. These findings indicate
                that reducing beaching events via changes in deployment
                locations may be difficult. As such, management approaches
                combining dFAD deployment limits, the use of biodegradable
                dFADs, recoveries at-sea close to sensitive areas and/or beached
                dFAD removal should be considered.

                With the increasing amount of data produced by numerical ocean
                models, so increases the need for efficient tools to analyse
                these data. One of these tools is Lagrangian ocean analysis,
                where a set of virtual particles are released and their dynamics
                is integrated in time based on fields defining the ocean state,
                including the hydrodynamics and biogeochemistry if available.
                This popular methodology needs to adapt to the large variety of
                models producing these fields at different formats. This is
                precisely the aim of Parcels, a Lagrangian ocean analysis
                framework designed to combine (1) a wide flexibility to model
                particles of different natures and (2) an efficient
                implementation in accordance with modern computing
                infrastructure. In the new Parcels v2.0, we implement a set of
                interpolation schemes to read various types of discretised
                fields, from rectilinear to curvilinear grids in the horizontal
                direction, from z- to s- levels in the vertical and different
                variable distributions such as the Arakawa's A-, B- and C-
                grids. In particular, we develop a new interpolation scheme for
                a three-dimensional curvilinear C-grid and analyse its
                properties. Parcels v2.0 capabilities, including a suite of
                meta-field objects, are then illustrated in a brief study of the
                distribution of floating microplastic in the North West European
                continental shelf and its sensitivity to different physical
                processes.

                Microfossils from plankton are used for paleoceanographic
                reconstructions. An often‐made assumption in quantitative
                microplankton‐based paleoceanographic reconstructions is that
                sedimentary assemblages represent conditions of the directly
                overlying surface water. However, any immobile particle sinking
                down the water column is subjected to transport by
                three‐dimensional currents, which results in a lateral
                relocation along transport. We model dinoflagellate cyst
                (dinocyst) transport in a high‐resolution (0.1° horizontally)
                global model of the present‐day ocean, and compare ocean
                conditions in the simulated origin of sedimentary particles to
                that in the directly overlying water. We find that the
                assumption that sedimentary particles represent the overlying
                surface waters is in most regions not valid. The bias induced by
                dinocyst transport depends on ocean current strength and
                direction, aggregation of particles which could increase the
                sinking speed, and the sediment sample depth. By using realistic
                sinking speeds of dinocysts and aggregates, extreme biases up to
                approximately ± 16°C warmer or ±4PSU saltier are found, while
                other regions show lower bias from particle transport. Our model
                results provide a way to mechanistically and statistically
                explain the unexpected occurrences of some dinocyst species
                outside of their `normal' occurrence region, such as the
                northerly occurrence of the allegedly sea‐ice‐affiliated
                dinocyst Selenopemphix antarctica. Exclusion of such outlier
                occurrences will yield better constrained ecological affinites
                for dinocyst species, which has implications for
                microfossil‐based quantitative and qualitative proxies for
                paleoceanographic conditions. We recommend paleoceanographers to
                a priori evaluate the (paleo‐)water depth, oceanographic
                setting, current strength and particle aggregation probability
                for their sedimentary microplankton assemblages.

                The increased use of drifting Fish Aggregating Devices (dFADs)
                by tuna purse seine fleets in recent years has supported
                considerable catches of these species. A greater understanding
                of the spatiotemporal dynamics of these objects as they drift
                with ocean currents is critical for understanding historical
                changes in fishing power, spatial management, and examining the
                effect of ambient dFAD density on catch and effort. Here, dFAD
                dynamics were estimated for all floating object sets made by
                purse seiners in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean during
                2016 and 2017. The drift trajectories of these floating objects
                prior to the observed fishing events were estimated by seeding
                virtual Lagrangian particles within a state-of-the-art
                hydrodynamics model, and simulating their movements backwards in
                time. Resulting trajectory distributions are similar to observed
                dFAD trajectories from the same period. The approach provides
                spatial density estimates in areas where observed dFAD data are
                incomplete, particularly in the exclusive economic zones (EEZ)
                of Howland and Baker Islands, and certain high seas zones. We
                provide estimates of inter-EEZ connectivity of dFADs, which
                highlight the fact that dFADs set upon in small EEZs such as
                Nauru and Howland and Baker Islands are likely to have drifted
                from neighbouring EEZs less than one month prior to fishing.
                dFADs typically transited multiple EEZs, with a median of 4 and
                a maximum of 14, when assuming a drift-time of six months.
                Moreover, 22% of dFAD sets made in the WCPO were estimated to
                have originated from the Eastern Pacific Ocean.&amp;#13; We
                examine our results in the context of the improved management
                and assessment of dFAD fisheries, providing a methodology to
                estimated relative dFAD density over historical periods to
                support analyses of catch and effort. The sensitivity of these
                estimates to hydrodynamic models, including the proposed SKIM
                doppler radar altimetry method, is discussed.

                Buoyant marine plastic debris has become a serious problem
                affecting the marine environment. To fully understand the impact
                of this problem, it is important to understand the dynamics of
                buoyant debris in the ocean. Buoyant debris accumulates in
                “garbage patches” in each of the subtropical ocean basins
                because of Ekman convergence and associated downwelling at
                subtropical latitudes. However, the precise dynamics of the
                garbage patches are not well understood. This is especially true
                in the southern Indian Ocean (SIO), where observations are
                inconclusive about the existence and numerical models predict
                inconsistent locations of the SIO garbage patch. In addition,
                the oceanic and atmospheric dynamics in the SIO are very
                different to those in the other oceans. The aim of this paper is
                to determine the dynamics of the SIO garbage patch at different
                depths and under different transport mechanisms such as ocean
                surface currents, Stokes drift and direct wind forcing. To
                achieve this, we use two types of ocean surface drifters as a
                proxy for buoyant debris. We derive transport matrices from
                observed drifter locations and simulate the global accumulation
                of buoyant debris. Our results indicate that the accumulation of
                buoyant debris in the SIO is much more sensitive to different
                transport mechanisms than in the other ocean basins. We relate
                this sensitivity to the unique oceanic and atmospheric dynamics
                of the SIO.

                Although marine plastic pollution has been the focus of several
                studies, there are still many gaps in our understanding of the
                concentrations, characteristics and impacts of plastics in the
                oceans. This study aimed to quantify and characterize plastic
                debris in oceanic surface waters of the Antarctic Peninsula.
                Sampling was done through surface trawls, and mean debris
                concentration was estimated at 1,794 items.km−2 with an average
                weight of 27.8 g.km−2. No statistical difference was found
                between the amount of mesoplastics (46%) and microplastics
                (54%). We found hard and flexible fragments, spheres and lines,
                in nine colors, composed mostly of polyurethane, polyamide, and
                polyethylene. An oceanographic dispersal model showed that, for
                at least seven years, sampled plastics likely did not originate
                from latitudes lower than 58°S. Analysis of epiplastic community
                diversity revealed bacteria, microalgae, and invertebrate groups
                adhered to debris. Paint fragments were present at all sampling
                stations and were approximately 30 times more abundant than
                plastics. Although paint particles were not included in plastic
                concentration estimates, we highlight that they could have
                similar impacts as marine plastics. We call for urgent action to
                avoid and mitigate plastic and paint fragment inputs to the
                Southern Ocean.

                Floating microplastic in the oceans is known to accumulate in
                the subtropical ocean gyres, but unclear is still what causes
                that accumulation. We investigate the role of various physical
                processes, such as surface Ekman and geostrophic currents,
                surface Stokes drift and mesoscale eddy activity, on the global
                surface distribution of floating microplastic with Lagrangian
                particle tracking using GlobCurrent and WaveWatch III reanalysis
                products. Globally, the locations of microplastic accumulation
                (accumulation zones) are largely determined by the Ekman
                currents. Simulations of the North Pacific and North Atlantic
                show that the locations of the modeled accumulation zones using
                GlobCurrent Total (Ekman+Geostrophic) currents generally agree
                with observed microplastic distributions in the North Pacific,
                and with the zonal distribution in the North Atlantic.
                Geostrophic currents and Stokes drift do not contribute to large
                scale microplastic accumulation in the subtropics, but Stokes
                drift leads to increased microplastic transport to Arctic
                regions. Since the WaveWatch III Stokes drift and GlobCurrent
                Ekman current datasets are not independent, combining Stokes
                drift with the other current components leads to an
                overestimation of Stokes drift effects and there is therefore a
                need for independent measurements of the different ocean
                circulation components. We investigate whether windage would be
                appropriate as a proxy for Stokes drift but find discrepancies
                in the modelled direction and magnitude. In the North Pacific,
                we find that microplastic tends to accumulate in regions of
                relatively low eddy kinetic energy, indicating low mesoscale
                eddy activity, but we do not see similar trends in the North
                Atlantic.

                after 25 h at 7 °C below ambient, whereas those from the Tasman
                Sea had elevated ROS in both warm and cool temperature extremes
                and greatest mortality at temperatures 6–10 °C above ambient,
                interpreted as the outcome of thermal stress. Tracking of water
                masses within an oceanographic circulation model showed
                populations had distinct thermal histories, with EAC
                pico-eukaryotes experiencing higher average temperatures for at
                least 1 week prior to sampling. While acclimatization and
                community assembly could both influence biological responses,
                this study clearly demonstrates that phenotypic divergence
                occurs along planktonic drift trajectories.

                This study examines the fine‐scale population genetic structure
                and phylogeography of the spiny lobster Panulirus homarus in the
                Western Indian Ocean. A seascape genetics approach was used to
                relate the observed genetic structure based on 21 microsatellite
                loci to ocean circulation patterns, and to determine the
                influence of latitude, sea surface temperature (SST), and ocean
                turbidity (KD490) on population‐level processes. At a geospatial
                level, the genetic clusters recovered corresponded to three
                putative subspecies, P. h. rubellus from the SW Indian Ocean, P.
                h. megasculptus from the NW Indian Ocean, and P. h. homarus from
                the tropical region in‐between. Virtual passive Lagrangian
                particles advected using satellite‐derived ocean surface
                currents were used to simulate larval dispersal. In the SW
                Indian Ocean, the dispersion of particles tracked over a 4‐month
                period provided insight into a steep genetic gradient observed
                at the Delagoa Bight, which separates P. h. rubellus and P. h.
                homarus. South of the contact zone, particles were advected
                southwestwards by prevailing boundary currents or were retained
                in nearshore eddies close to release locations. Some particles
                released in southeast Madagascar dispersed across the Mozambique
                Channel and reached the African shelf. Dispersal was
                characterized by high seasonal and inter‐annual variability, and
                a large proportion of particles were dispersed far offshore and
                presumably lost. In the NW Indian Ocean, particles were retained
                within the Arabian Sea. Larval retention and self‐recruitment in
                the Arabian Sea could explain the recent genetic divergence
                between P. h. megasculptus and P. h. homarus. Geographic
                distance and minimum SST were significantly associated with
                genetic differentiation in multivariate analysis, suggesting
                that larval tolerance to SST plays a role in shaping the
                population structure of P. homarus.

                The distribution of marine species is often modeled using
                Eulerian approaches, in which changes to population density or
                abundance are calculated at fixed locations in space.
                Conversely, Lagrangian, or individual-based, models simulate the
                movement of individual particles moving in continuous space,
                with broader-scale patterns such as distribution being an
                emergent property of many, potentially adaptive, individuals.
                These models offer advantages in examining dynamics across
                spatiotemporal scales and making comparisons with observations
                from individual-scale data.
                <br />
                Here, we introduce and describe such a model, the
                Individual-based Kinesis, Advection and Movement of Ocean
                ANimAls model (Ikamoana), which we use to replicate the movement
                processes of an existing Eulerian model for marine predators
                (the Spatial Ecosystem and Population Dynamics Model, SEAPODYM).
                Ikamoana simulates the movement of either individual or groups
                of animals by physical ocean currents, habitat- dependent
                stochastic movements (kinesis), and taxis movements representing
                active searching behaviours.
                <br />
                Applying our model to Pacific skipjack tuna (Katsuwonus
                pelamis), we show that it accurately replicates the evolution of
                density distribution simulated by SEAPODYM with low time-mean
                error and a spatial correlation of density that exceeds 0.96 at
                all times. We demonstrate how the Lagrangian approach permits
                easy tracking of individuals’ trajectories for examining
                connectivity between different regions, and show how the model
                can provide independent estimates of transfer rates between
                commonly used assessment regions. In particular, we find that
                retention rates in most assessment regions are considerably
                smaller (up to a factor of 2) than those estimated by this
                populations primary assessment model. Moreover, these rates are
                sensitive to ocean state (e.g. El Nino vs La Nina) and so
                assuming fixed transfer rates between regions may lead to
                spurious stock estimates. A novel feature of the Lagrangian
                approach is that individual schools can be tracked through time,
                and we demonstrate that movement between two assessment regions
                at broad temporal scales includes extended transits through
                other regions.
                <br />
                Finally, we discuss the utility of this modeling framework for
                the management of marine reserves, designing effective
                monitoring programmes, and exploring hypotheses regarding the
                behaviour of hard-to-observe oceanic animals.

                In this study, we assess the accuracy of a combined geostrophic
                and Ekman current product (GlobCurrent) that estimates ocean
                currents at 15 m depth, by coupling it to a synthetic particle
                tracking tool and comparing the virtual trajectories to those of
                surface drifting buoys drogued at 15 m in the Greater Agulhas
                Current Region. The velocities from a total of 1,041 drifters
                are compared and evaluated to the synthetic particle-derived
                velocities for the period 1993–2015. On average the GlobCurrent
                underestimates the velocity in the Greater Agulhas Current by
                approximately 27%. The underestimation ranges from 4–64% in
                different regions, with the smallest error found in the Agulhas
                retroflection region, and the highest in the Benguela Upwelling
                System. Furthermore, we compare the time taken for the
                separation between the virtual and real drifters to reach 35 km.
                The mean separation time was found to be 78 hours, with the
                shortest time (35 hours) found in the Agulhas Current and the
                longest time (116 hours) located in the Agulhas Return Current.
                Deploying 10,000 virtual drifters in a 1degree x 1degree box
                within the southern Agulhas Current shows a convergence of
                trajectories towards the core of the current, while higher
                divergence is evident in the Agulhas retroflection. To evaluate
                the utility of this synthetic particle tracking tool coupled
                with GlobCurrent in open ocean search and rescue operations, two
                test cases are examined: (1) a capsized catamaran spotted south
                of Cape Recife and recovered 5 days later south of Cape Agulhas;
                and (2) a drifter trajectory in the same region. The comparison
                suggests that the GlobCurrent forced synthetic particle tracking
                tool is not appropriate for predicting the trajectory of a
                capsized catamaran that does not have the same drift
                characteristics as a surface drifting buoy drogued to 15 m.

                Global surface transport in the ocean can be represented by
                using the observed trajectories of drifters to calculate
                probability distribution functions. The oceanographic
                applications of the Markov Chain approach to modelling include
                tracking of floating debris and water masses, globally and on
                yearly-to-centennial timescales. Here, we analyse the error

                consequences for ocean transport modelling and detection of
                accumulation structures. A sensitivity analysis of Markov Chain

                barrier - we assess the capacity of the Markov Chain methodology
                to detect surface connectivity and dynamic transport barriers.
                Finally, we extend the methodology's functionality to separate
                the geostrophic and non-geostrophic contributions to inter-ocean
                exchange in these key regions.

                Lagrangian analysis is a powerful way to analyse the output of
                ocean circulation models and other ocean velocity data such as
                from altimetry. In the Lagrangian approach, large sets of
                virtual particles are integrated within the three-dimensional,
                time-evolving velocity fields. Over several decades, a variety
                of tools and methods for this purpose have emerged. Here, we
                review the state of the art in the field of Lagrangian analysis
                of ocean velocity data, starting from a fundamental kinematic
                framework and with a focus on large-scale open ocean
                applications. Beyond the use of explicit velocity fields, we
                consider the influence of unresolved physics and dynamics on
                particle trajectories. We comprehensively list and discuss the
                tools currently available for tracking virtual particles. We
                then showcase some of the innovative applications of trajectory
                data, and conclude with some open questions and an outlook. The
                overall goal of this review paper is to reconcile some of the
                different techniques and methods in Lagrangian ocean analysis,
                while recognising the rich diversity of codes that have and
                continue to emerge, and the challenges of the coming age of
                petascale computing.

                As ocean general circulation models (OGCMs) move into the
                petascale age, where the output of single simulations exceeds
                petabytes of storage space, tools to analyse the output of these
                models will need to scale up too. Lagrangian ocean analysis,
                where virtual particles are tracked through hydrodynamic fields,
                is an increasingly popular way to analyse OGCM output, by
                mapping pathways and connectivity of biotic and abiotic
                particulates. However, the current software stack of Lagrangian
                ocean analysis codes is not dynamic enough to cope with the
                increasing complexity, scale and need for customization of
                use-cases. Furthermore, most community codes are developed for
                stand-alone use, making it a nontrivial task to integrate
                virtual particles at runtime of the OGCM. Here, we introduce the
                new Parcels code, which was designed from the ground up to be
                sufficiently scalable to cope with petascale computing. We
                highlight its API design that combines flexibility and
                customization with the ability to optimize for HPC workflows,
                following the paradigm of domain-specific languages. Parcels is
                primarily written in Python, utilizing the wide range of tools
                available in the scientific Python ecosystem, while generating
                low-level C code and using just-in-time compilation for
                performance-critical computation. We show a worked-out example
                of its API, and validate the accuracy of the code against seven
                idealized test cases. This version 0.9 of Parcels is focused on
                laying out the API, with future work concentrating on support
                for curvilinear grids, optimization, efficiency and at-runtime
                coupling with OGCMs.
