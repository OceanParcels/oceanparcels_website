**In 2025, Parcels will be 10 years old! To celebrate this milestone, we are planning a workshop-conference-hackathon-party in Utrecht, Netherlands, from October 1-3, 2025. We like to invite you to join us for this event!**

Michael Lange committed [b2ae2fd](https://github.com/OceanParcels/Parcels/commit/b2ae2fd44979c125fbc21f2c939289db62dc4816) on 29 September 2015, and weâ€™ve come a long way since then (we didnâ€™t even have an acronym at that point!). [More than 200 articles have been published using Parcels](/papers-citing-parcels#papers-citing-parcels), on topics ranging from winds on Jupiter (the planet) and iceberg melt to AUV steering and tuna (the fish) behaviour.

Weâ€™ve also started work on a major, radical overhaul of the Parcels codebase (what we call [v4](https://docs.oceanparcels.org/en/v4-dev/v4/)). The next major release of Parcels will be even more powerful and versatile - including support for unstructured grids!

From Wednesday 1 to Friday 3 October 2025, we will organise a _free_ event, which can be attended both in-person in Utrecht and virtually online. The goal is to showcase how Parcels is used by different researchers, and learn from each other. This can include presentations, tutorials and hackathons. Our hope is that we then also have the first (pre)release of the new Parcels v4 to test-drive then.

We will also hold a party on Friday evening 3 October 2025, in Utrecht. This is to celebrate how far weâ€™ve come, and to thank you all for your contributions and engagement over the years.
