summary: 'On October 1-3 2025, we will celebrate the 10 year anniversary of Parcels in Utrecht, Netherlands, with a workshop-conference-hackathon-party.'
---

**In 2025, Parcels will be 10 years old!**

To celebrate this milestone, we are planning a **workshop-conference-hackathon-party in [Utrecht](https://maps.app.goo.gl/vQhBLecygz3tGiCE6) from October 1-3, 2025.**

**Please join us for this free event!** You can attend in-person in Utrecht or virtually online.

The goal of the event is to showcase how Parcels is used by different researchers, and learn from each other. There will be workshops, tutorials, hackathons and a mini-conference.

You will also be able to sneak-peak and test-drive the first (pre)release of the **[new Parcels v4](https://docs.oceanparcels.org/en/v4-dev/v4/)**, a major, radical overhaul of the Parcels codebase. Parcels v4 will be even more powerful and versatile - including support for unstructured grids!

The event will end with a party on Friday evening 3 October 2025, in Utrecht. This is to celebrate how far weâ€™ve come, and to thank you all for your contributions and engagement over the years.

Preference will be given to early career researchers and people from low- and middle-income countries.

## Background of the event

Michael Lange committed [b2ae2fd](https://github.com/OceanParcels/Parcels/commit/b2ae2fd44979c125fbc21f2c939289db62dc4816) on 29 September 2015, and weâ€™ve come a long way since then (we didnâ€™t even have an acronym at that point!).

[More than 200 articles have been published using Parcels](/papers-citing-parcels#papers-citing-parcels), on topics ranging from winds on Jupiter (the planet) and iceberg melt to AUV steering and tuna (the fish) behaviour.
