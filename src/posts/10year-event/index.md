summary: 'On October 1-3 2025, we celebrated the 10 year anniversary of Parcels in Utrecht, Netherlands, with a workshop-conference-hackathon-party.'
---

**In 2025, Parcels turned 10 years old!** To celebrate this milestone, we held a **workshop-conference-hackathon-party in [Utrecht](https://maps.app.goo.gl/vQhBLecygz3tGiCE6) from October 1-3, 2025.**

The goal of the event was to showcase how Parcels is used by different researchers, and learn from each other. There were workshops, tutorials, hackathons and a mini-conference.

Attendees were also able to sneak-peak and test-drive the first (pre)release of the **[new Parcels v4](https://docs.oceanparcels.org/en/v4-dev/v4/)**, a major, radical overhaul of the Parcels codebase. Parcels v4 is even more powerful and versatile - including support for unstructured grids!

The event ended with a party on Friday evening 3 October 2025, in Utrecht. This was to celebrate how far we’ve come, and to thank all for their contributions and engagement over the years.

## Funding

The Parcels anniversary event was financially supported by the Dutch Research Council NWO, under the project "Tracing Marine Macroplastics by Unraveling the Ocean’s Multiscale Transport Processes" with file
number VI.C.222.025.

## Background of the event

Michael Lange committed [b2ae2fd](https://github.com/OceanParcels/Parcels/commit/b2ae2fd44979c125fbc21f2c939289db62dc4816) on 29 September 2015, and we’ve come a long way since then (we didn’t even have an acronym at that point!).

[More than 200 articles have been published using Parcels](/papers-citing-parcels#papers-citing-parcels), on topics ranging from winds on Jupiter (the planet) and iceberg melt to AUV steering and tuna (the fish) behaviour.
