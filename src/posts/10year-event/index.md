summary: 'On October 1-3 2025, we celebrated the 10 year anniversary of Parcels in Utrecht, Netherlands, with a workshop-conference-hackathon-party.'
---

**In 2025, Parcels turned 10 years old!** To celebrate this milestone, we held a **workshop-conference-hackathon-party in [Utrecht](https://maps.app.goo.gl/vQhBLecygz3tGiCE6) from October 1-3, 2025.**

The goal of the event was to showcase how Parcels is used by different researchers, and learn from each other. There were workshops, tutorials, hackathons and a mini-conference.

Attendees were also able to sneak-peak and test-drive the first (pre)release of the **[new Parcels v4](https://docs.parcels-code.org/en/v4-dev/v4/)**, a major, radical overhaul of the Parcels codebase. Parcels v4 is even more powerful and versatile - including support for unstructured grids!

The event ended with a party on Friday evening 3 October 2025, in Utrecht. This was to celebrate how far weâ€™ve come, and to thank all for their contributions and engagement over the years.

## Funding

The Parcels anniversary event was financially supported by the Dutch Research Council NWO, under the project "Tracing Marine Macroplastics by Unraveling the Oceanâ€™s Multiscale Transport Processes" with file
number VI.C.222.025.

## Background of the event

Michael Lange committed [b2ae2fd](https://github.com/OceanParcels/Parcels/commit/b2ae2fd44979c125fbc21f2c939289db62dc4816) on 29 September 2015, and weâ€™ve come a long way since then (we didnâ€™t even have an acronym at that point!).

[More than 200 articles have been published using Parcels](/papers-citing-parcels#papers-citing-parcels), on topics ranging from winds on Jupiter (the planet) and iceberg melt to AUV steering and tuna (the fish) behaviour.
