summary: 'In 2023 and 2024, we deployed drifters in the Dutch Wadden Sea to track the movement of plastic pollution. In this post, we give background and show how the can be tracked.'

# What are the drifters?

The drifters are so-called <b>Stokes drifters</b>, built by [MetOcean](https://metocean.com/products/stokes-drifter/) in Canada. They are small, white, floating devices that are designed to follow the water motion in the Wadden Sea. The drifters are equipped with a GPS and a satellite transmitter, so that we can track their position in real time.

# If you found a drifter?

If you have found a drifter on the beach, it is important to leave the drifter where it is (do not touch it), as one of the goals of the project is to measure how high tides and storms move the drifters back into the ocean.

We would appreciate it if you could send us a photo and information about where you found the drifter, at [E.vanSebille@uu.nl](mailto:e.vansebille@uu.nl).

# Tracking the 2023 batch

We deployed the first batch of 24 drifters from the R/V Adriaen Coenen on 14 November 2023. Their tracks can be seen in the interactive map below.

# Tracking the 2024 batch

We deployed the second batch of 12 drifters from just north of [Moddergat](https://maps.app.goo.gl/YoBDXxKDyHqNmW3s7) on 25 April 2024. Their tracks can be seen in the interactive map below.

The deployment was at low tide on the mudflats just north of Moddergat, as shown in the photo below (photo by Daan Reijnders).
