We are excited to announce the launch of the new website for parcels-code.org!

The timing couldn't be better as we are actively developing version 4.0 of Parcels, which will bring significant improvements to the framework and tighter integration with the [Pangeo](https://pangeo.io/) ecosystem. The new website will help showcase these upcoming features and allow us to make announcements to the Parcels community.

The website design is based on the excellent [Xarray website](https://xarray.dev). Thank you to the Xarray team for their work here and their continued work on the Xarray project!
