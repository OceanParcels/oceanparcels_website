We are excited to announce the launch of the new website for OceanParcels.org!

The timing couldn't be better as we are actively developing version 4.0 of Parcels, which will bring significant improvements to the framework and tighter integration with the [Pangeo](https://pangeo.io/) ecosystem. The new website will help showcase these upcoming features and allow us to make announcements to the Parcels community.

The website design is based on the excellent [Xarray website](https://xarray.dev). Thank you to the Xarray team for their work here and their continued work on the Xarray project!
