On Wednesday 1 to Friday 3 October, we will host a series of workshops, a conference, and a hackathon, both in-person in Utrecht and online. See [the event website](https://oceanparcels.org/blog/10year-event) for more details.

There are two links to join virtually that will remain the same for the entire anniversary event:
